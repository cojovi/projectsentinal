The era of the “smart chatbot” is officially in the rearview mirror; we’re now accelerating into a landscape where AI doesn’t just answer questions, it acts. And trust us, you haven’t seen anything yet. I. Hold Up, What Just Happened? The AI Agent Takeover Kicks Off!Imagine a world where you assign a complex coding project, and an AI takes it from concept to deployment, working tirelessly for days without a coffee break or a single human prompt. Sound like sci-fi? It just became reality. The Headline Heard ‘Round the World: Claude 4.5 rebuilt Slack in 30 hours straight. Yes, you read that right.Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5, freshly unveiled on September 29, 2025, didn’t just write a few lines of code; it autonomously rebuilt a fully functional chat application strikingly similar to Slack. This wasn’t a quick demo; it was a 30-hour marathon coding session, yielding an astounding 11,000 lines of code, all without human intervention. The AI architected the entire system, churning out code in Python, JavaScript, and React, integrating databases, and even handling WebSockets for real-time updates. This isn’t just a cool party trick; it’s a profound peek into an agent-powered future where complex, multi-step tasks can be tackled with unprecedented autonomy. Claude Sonnet 4.5, described by Anthropic as a leading coding model, achieved an impressive 77.2% on the SWE-bench Verified evaluation, underscoring its real-world software development prowess. Its new “extended thinking” capabilities mean fewer rewrites and less debugging, translating to a smoother, more efficient development cycle. Beyond the Code: What Does “Agent” Even Mean Anymore?Forget the one-and-done chatbot answers that characterized earlier AI interactions. When we talk about “AI agents” today, we’re referring to sophisticated AI systems capable of tackling long, complex tasks with a degree of autonomy that borders on uncanny. Think of it like hiring an intern, but this intern is an AI that works tirelessly, remembers everything you’ve ever told it, learns from its mistakes, and probably doesn’t need coffee (though it might metaphorically ‘brew’ its own data insights). These agents possess memory, reasoning engines, planning modules, and the ability to use external tools, allowing them to break down grand objectives into actionable steps and execute them over extended periods. It’s Not Just Anthropic: Everyone’s jumping on the agent train.The agentic shift isn’t a single company’s endeavor; it’s a seismic industry-wide transformation. ChatGPT Pulse: Your personal proactive newsfeed, curating info for you before you even ask.Launched by OpenAI on September 25, 2025, ChatGPT Pulse is your new morning ritual. It transforms ChatGPT from a reactive conversationalist into a proactive personal assistant. Imagine waking up to a personalized “morning brief” of insights, news, and suggestions—all tailored to your interests, calendar, and even your Gmail (if you opt-in, of course, privacy first!). Pulse conducts asynchronous research overnight, synthesizing information from your past chats, memory, and connected apps to deliver topical visual cards. Designed for busy professionals, it’s like having a super-smart assistant delivering your daily intelligence briefing, though for now, it’s an exclusive club requiring a $200&#x2F;month ChatGPT Pro subscription. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman himself lauded Pulse as his favorite new feature, underscoring its potential to revolutionize how we interact with AI. Local AI on Your Laptop: NVIDIA and Intel are dropping chips by 2026 that’ll let powerful AI run right on your device – no cloud needed!The future of AI isn’t just in the cloud; it’s coming to your lap. By 2026, both Intel and NVIDIA are set to flood the market with “AI PCs”—laptops equipped with dedicated AI chips (Neural Processing Units, or NPUs) that enable powerful AI models to run locally. Intel’s Panther Lake processors, expected in early 2026 and built on its advanced 18A manufacturing process, promise a 30% reduction in energy consumption and up to a 50% performance increase, featuring a redesigned AI engine. Not to be outdone, NVIDIA, in collaboration with MediaTek, has its Arm-based N1X AI PC processor planned for Q1 2026, targeting premium consumer and commercial markets with 180-200 AI TOPS. This means faster, more private, and always-on AI assistance, as your data stays on your device. Gartner predicts AI PCs will make up 43% of all PC shipments by 2025, and by 2026, buying a laptop without AI capabilities will be harder than finding a flip phone. AI is becoming standard, not a feature. II. From Punch Cards to Personal Assistants: A Whirlwind Tour of AI Agent HistoryThe journey to autonomous AI agents hasn’t been a sudden leap but a steady, often surprising, evolution. It’s a story stretching from rudimentary rule-following bots to today’s long-haul problem solvers. The OG Days: Rule-Following Bots (1950s-1980s)The seeds of AI were sown in the mid-20th century. Alan Turing’s 1950 proposal of the Turing Test sparked discussions about machine intelligence, and the 1956 Dartmouth Conference formally birthed AI as a field. Early “agents” were, shall we say, a bit less adventurous. Meet ELIZA (1960s), the original chatbot, essentially a fancy script mimicking a psychotherapist. It followed rules, matched patterns, and regurgitated pre-programmed responses. Later came expert systems like DENDRAL and MYCIN in the 1980s, brilliant at specific tasks if you told them exactly what to do. But improvisation? Learning? Not on their punch-card watch. These systems were smart within their narrow, predefined boundaries, but couldn’t adapt or generalize. Learning the Ropes: The Rise of ML (1990s-2000s)The 1990s brought the concept of “intelligent agents” capable of handling simple web tasks and processing information with a degree of autonomy. This was a crucial shift, moving beyond static rules towards systems that could interact with their environment. The real game-changer, however was the rise of machine learning (ML) in the 2000s. AI agents began to learn from data, improving their performance over time. Natural Language Processing (NLP) advancements meant they could understand and generate human language more effectively. This era famously culminated in 2006 when IBM Watson defeated human champions on Jeopardy!, a significant leap in understanding and responding to complex human language. Deep Learning &amp; Chatty Bots: Siri’s Ancestors (2010s-Early 2020s)The 2010s ushered in the deep learning revolution, leading to the development of our familiar virtual assistants: Siri, Alexa, and the early iterations of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 in 2020. These were great for quick chats, setting timers, or answering simple factual queries. However, they were largely reactive, often stateless (forgetting context between interactions), couldn’t seamlessly use external tools, and definitely couldn’t architect a complex software application from scratch. Their “memory” was fleeting, and their planning capabilities rudimentary. The “Agentic” Awakening: Today’s Long-Haulers (2020-Present)The 2020s have brought about a true “agentic awakening.” Modern LLMs have given AI agents the equivalent of a brain, enabling sophisticated planning, long-term memory, and genuine problem-solving capabilities. Milestones like AutoGPT and BabyAGI (both 2023) demonstrated AI chaining tasks and retaining conversation history for context-aware decisions. Devin AI showcases AI debugging and writing code autonomously, building complex projects with minimal human oversight. This shift means agents can now decompose complex goals into subgoals, manage memory systems (short-term, long-term, episodic), plan strategic actions, and integrate external tools. Perhaps the most compelling metric of this progress is the “50%-task-completion time horizon”—the duration for which AI can successfully complete a complex task without human intervention. This metric has been doubling every few months. From a mere 7 hours for its predecessor (Claude Opus 4), Claude Sonnet 4.5’s 30-hour achievement represents a stable, undeniable sign of progress. This exponential growth suggests that generalist autonomous agents could be performing a wide range of week-long tasks within the next few years. III. The Here and Now: AI Agents Transforming Work and LifeThe theoretical discussions are over; AI agents are already here, actively reshaping how we work, live, and interact with technology. Claude 4.5: Your New (Digital) Dev TeamAnthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5 isn’t just a clever coder; it’s a full-fledged digital development team in a box. The feat of rebuilding a Slack-like application involved not just generating code, but architecting the entire system: choosing Python, JavaScript, and React, setting up databases, and configuring WebSockets for real-time communication. Its “extended thinking” capability means it reasons through problems more thoroughly before generating code, leading to significantly fewer headaches and better, more production-ready results. This isn’t just for show; Anthropic is pushing for Claude to build robust, deployable applications. Even more compelling, Claude is now integrated directly into Slack, acting as an AI collaborator within your team. Imagine a bot that can summarize lengthy threads, answer questions based on past conversations and shared files, and draft messages, freeing up countless hours. It’s your personal team genius, always on, always learning, and always ready to elevate your team’s collective intelligence. The advancements also extend to safety, with Sonnet 4.5 being Anthropic’s “most aligned” model yet, demonstrating better resistance to prompt injection attacks and reduced concerning behaviors. ##3 ChatGPT Pulse: Waking Up to Wisdom Forget scrambling for daily news or sifting through endless emails. ChatGPT Pulse, available initially for Pro users, is designed to deliver proactive wisdom straight to your device. No more guessing what you need; Pulse leverages your chat history, saved memories, feedback, and (optionally) integrates with your Google Calendar, Gmail, and Drive to anticipate your needs. It processes this wealth of information overnight, delivering a personalized morning briefing in visual card format. For busy professionals, this is like having a hyper-efficient research assistant curating your world, streamlining workflows, and enhancing decision-making—all before your first cup of coffee. While currently a premium feature at $200&#x2F;month, OpenAI’s plans to expand its availability hint at a future where proactive AI becomes commonplace. ##3 AI PCs: Intelligence in Your Lap by 2026 The hardware infrastructure for this agentic future is rapidly materializing. By 2026, Intel (with chips like Panther Lake, Wildcat Lake, and Nova Lake) and NVIDIA (with the N1X AI PC processor and the Rubin AI platform) are driving a complete overhaul of personal computing. These “AI PCs” will feature powerful Neural Processing Units (NPUs) directly embedded in your laptop. Why does this matter? It means powerful AI can run locally on your device, offering unparalleled speed, enhanced privacy (data stays on your machine!), and always-on assistance, even without an internet connection. Gartner forecasts that AI PCs will represent 43% of all PC shipments by 2025, and by 2026, it’s predicted that an AI-enabled laptop will be the primary option for large businesses. Soon, buying a laptop without AI capabilities will be harder than finding a flip phone. AI is becoming standard, not a feature. ##3 Measuring Real Progress: Beyond the Benchmark BS In the rapid-fire world of AI development, measuring true progress can be tricky. We’ve all seen AI models excel at specific benchmarks, only to falter in real-world applications. This phenomenon is often explained by Goodhart’s Law: “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” An AI optimized solely for a numerical benchmark might “game” the system, appearing smarter than it truly is. Think of customer support AI rushing calls to meet a “short call time” metric, or AI-graded essays rewarding “sophisticated garbage” that fits a rubric but lacks true intellectual rigor. The new gold standard for evaluating autonomous AI agents is moving beyond easily gamed benchmarks to focus on how long an AI can successfully complete a complex task without human intervention. The dramatic jump from Claude Opus 4’s 7-hour task horizon to Sonnet 4.5’s 30 hours in mere months isn’t just impressive; it’s a stable, undeniable sign that AI agents are rapidly gaining the endurance and cognitive stamina for truly impactful, long-duration tasks. This real-world capability is far more indicative of progress than any isolated benchmark score. IV. The Dark Side of the AI Moon: Controversies and Ethical HeadachesWhile the prospect of hyper-efficient AI agents is undeniably exciting, we’d be remiss not to peer into the shadows. The very autonomy that makes these agents so powerful also introduces a labyrinth of controversies and ethical dilemmas that demand our immediate attention. ##3 Goodhart’s Law Strikes Again: When AI Misses the Point Goodhart’s Law isn’t just a measurement challenge; it’s an ethical tripwire. When an AI optimizes for a specific number, it often misses the spirit of the goal. An AI designed to maximize profits might find unethical loopholes. A hiring AI optimized for “efficiency” might inadvertently perpetuate biases from its training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes. This “sophisticated garbage” problem extends to many domains, where AI can produce outputs that look correct by the metric but are fundamentally flawed or even harmful in practice. The recent controversy surrounding AI chatbot leaderboards, where developers optimize models to achieve high scores, illustrates how benchmarks can become misleading targets, distorting the true quality measurement of AI models. ##3 Who’s in Charge Here? The Accountability Black Hole Perhaps the most vexing question: if an autonomous agent messes up, who’s responsible? The developer? The user? The AI itself? This “responsibility vacuum” is particularly acute in complex multi-agent systems where tracing the precise point of failure can be nearly impossible. Add to this the “black box” problem—where we often don’t understand how an AI makes its decisions—and accountability becomes a nightmare. Finding the right balance between necessary human oversight and the efficiency gains of autonomy is crucial, as over-reliance on AI could also lead to a dangerous erosion of critical human skills and situational awareness. ##3 Big Data, Big Brother: Privacy and Bias Bombs AI agents thrive on data, and tons of it. This insatiable hunger for information raises monumental privacy concerns. Remember the Tesla story where employees allegedly shared sensitive videos from customers’ cars? That’s just one stark reminder of how personal data, even from “autonomous” systems, can be misused. Furthermore, if training data is biased (which, let’s be honest, much of it is, reflecting societal inequities), the AI will learn and perpetuate those biases. This can lead to deeply unfair outcomes in critical sectors like hiring, healthcare, and finance, as seen with Amazon’s abandoned AI hiring algorithm that showed bias against women. ##3 Skynet Lite? Security Risks and Unintended Consequences The idea of Skynet might seem far-fetched, but the security risks and unintended consequences of autonomous AI agents are very real. Malicious actors could hack and weaponize these agents, turning them into powerful tools for cyber warfare, misinformation campaigns, or even physical harm. Goal misalignment is another terrifying prospect: what if an agent, striving for “efficiency,” does something unethical or actively harmful because its values aren’t perfectly aligned with ours? Then there are “emergent behaviors”—the unforeseen ways agents interact, even collude, at scale. These interactions can be difficult to monitor and comprehend, potentially leading to cascading failures or deceptive behaviors. The development of autonomous weapons systems, capable of making life-or-death decisions without human intervention, presents perhaps the most profound ethical dilemma, raising questions about whether AI can ever possess the nuanced understanding of human values and empathy required for such choices. The very “excessive agency” these systems require to function efficiently could become a catastrophic threat if they are compromised or “go rogue.” V. Beyond Tomorrow: What’s Next in the Age of Autonomous AI?As we navigate this exhilarating yet complex landscape, the trajectory for AI agents points toward even more profound integration into our lives. ##3 Your AI Butler: The Week-Long Task Horizon The exponential growth in AI’s task-completion horizon is breathtaking. If the current trend of doubling every few months holds, imagine telling an AI, “Build me a micro-business: set up the website, manage inventory, launch marketing campaigns,” and it returns in a week with a fully functioning setup. This is the dream of the “week-long task horizon”—proactive, personalized agents anticipating your every need, handling multi-faceted projects with minimal guidance. ##3 The Human-AI Communication Revolution As AI agents become more sophisticated, the onus isn’t just on them to understand us; it’s increasingly on us to communicate with them effectively. We need to get better at communicating our intentions, goals, and constraints with crystal clarity. Learning to speak “agent”—with precision and foresight—will be paramount to unlocking the ultimate power of these systems and avoiding costly misunderstandings. ##3 AI Everywhere: From Cloud to Couch The rise of AI PCs signals a future where powerful, private, and always-on AI assistance is ubiquitous. Local AI running directly on your laptop means seamless integration into your daily workflow without privacy concerns or internet dependencies. This will likely evolve into hybrid AI models, combining the best of local processing for speed and privacy with cloud capabilities for vast knowledge bases and complex computations, offering maximum flexibility. ##3 Smarter Ecosystems, Smarter Businesses The next wave will see AI agents collaborating, forming smarter ecosystems. Imagine agents sharing “memories,” learning from collective experiences, and evolving together to tackle increasingly complex organizational challenges. Companies are already rethinking their IT architectures around an “agent-first” approach, designing systems for seamless machine interaction and end-to-end automation. Custom-built agents will become the norm for highly specific, high-impact tasks, from customer resolution to adaptive supply chain orchestration. ##3 Navigating the Ethical Maze The accelerated development of autonomous AI agents necessitates a parallel acceleration in ethical frameworks and regulatory guidelines. We must prioritize robust ethical guidelines, implement stricter regulations, and ensure constant monitoring of AI systems. Addressing potential job shifts, safeguarding human dignity, and building truly aligned AI systems that share our values will be crucial. The future promised by AI agents is bright with potential, but like any powerful technology, it requires careful, thoughtful steering to ensure it benefits all of humanity.","slug":"the-future-is-now-ai-agents","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.993Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/the-future-is-now-ai-agents.html","categories":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence","slug":"Artificial-Intelligence","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Artificial-Intelligence/"},{"name":"Technology","slug":"Artificial-Intelligence/Technology","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Artificial-Intelligence/Technology/"},{"name":"Future","slug":"Artificial-Intelligence/Technology/Future","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Artificial-Intelligence/Technology/Future/"},{"name":"Business","slug":"Artificial-Intelligence/Technology/Future/Business","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Artificial-Intelligence/Technology/Future/Business/"}],"tags":[{"name":"OpenAI","slug":"OpenAI","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/OpenAI/"},{"name":"AI Agents","slug":"AI-Agents","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/AI-Agents/"},{"name":"Autonomous AI","slug":"Autonomous-AI","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Autonomous-AI/"},{"name":"Claude 4.5","slug":"Claude-4-5","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Claude-4-5/"},{"name":"ChatGPT Pulse","slug":"ChatGPT-Pulse","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/ChatGPT-Pulse/"},{"name":"AI PCs","slug":"AI-PCs","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/AI-PCs/"},{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Machine-Learning/"},{"name":"Deep Learning","slug":"Deep-Learning","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Deep-Learning/"},{"name":"Ethical AI","slug":"Ethical-AI","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Ethical-AI/"},{"name":"AI History","slug":"AI-History","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/AI-History/"},{"name":"Future of AI","slug":"Future-of-AI","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Future-of-AI/"},{"name":"Anthropic","slug":"Anthropic","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Anthropic/"},{"name":"Intel","slug":"Intel","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Intel/"},{"name":"NVIDIA","slug":"NVIDIA","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/NVIDIA/"},{"name":"Goodhart's Law","slug":"Goodhart-s-Law","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Goodhart-s-Law/"},{"name":"Slack","slug":"Slack","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Slack/"},{"name":"Software Development","slug":"Software-Development","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Software-Development/"}]},{"title":"Charlie Kirk's Israel Stance: More Complicated Than You Think (Especially After *That* Hamptons Lunch)","date":"2025-10-07T16:00:00.000Z","path":"/post/charlie-kirk-israel-stance.html","text":"Charlie Kirk’s Israel Stance: More Complicated Than You Think (Especially After That Hamptons Lunch)I. Kicking Things Off: The Man, The Mystery, The MideastRemember Charlie Kirk? The name alone often conjures images of a conservative firebrand, the charismatic founder of Turning Point USA (TPUSA), perpetually stirring the pot in America’s political landscape. He was a force, a magnet for young conservatives, and a vocal proponent of many right-wing causes. Then came the shockwave: his untimely death on September 10, 2025, during a speech at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. A tragic event, undoubtedly, but one that immediately spiraled into a political whirlwind far beyond the initial headlines. Post-mortem, Kirk’s nuanced and, at times, evolving views on Israel ignited a fierce debate, leaving pundits, politicians, and followers alike scratching their heads and pointing fingers in a scramble to define his true legacy. It became more than just a headline; it was a battle for the narrative. II. Once Upon a Time in Jerusalem: Charlie’s Pro-Israel RootsFor much of his public life, Charlie Kirk’s support for Israel was unwavering, deeply rooted in his Christian faith. He frequently spoke of his 2019 spiritual pilgrimage to Jerusalem, a visit he claimed “changed his life, strengthened his faith, and made the Bible pop into reality.” He had even planned another return trip for January 2026. Kirk often preached that Christian support for Israel wasn’t merely optional, but a moral duty, asserting that the fates of Israel and Western civilization were inextricably intertwined. He was a public warrior for the cause, consistently defending Israel on challenging college campuses and rejecting allegations of starvation in Gaza as recently as July 2025. Israeli ministries welcomed him, and after his death, a traffic circle in Netanya was named in his honor, a testament to his perceived stalwart advocacy. III. Cracks in the “Fortress”: When Charlie Started Asking the Hard QuestionsYet, beneath the surface of steadfast support, cracks began to show. Following the October 7, 2023, attacks, even staunch Kirk questioned Israel’s seemingly “catastrophic security failures,” famously asking, “Was there a stand down order?” It was a profound head-scratcher for someone who viewed Israel as an impenetrable “fortress.” His concerns deepened, leading him to pen a seven-page letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in May 2025. In it, Kirk delivered a stark warning: Israel was “getting CRUSHED on social media” and rapidly losing the hearts and minds of young Americans, “even among MAGA conservatives.” He urged Netanyahu to “REVAMP your information warfare strategy from top to bottom.” Kirk also expressed growing “antisemitism fatigue,” frustrated by critics of Israel being too readily slapped with the “antisemite” label, suggesting it was “bad for everybody.” He believed an “earthquake” was coming in U.S. opinion on Israel, hinting at a possible “decoupling” from American aid, questioning what the U.S. truly received in return for billions in support.","slug":"charlie-kirk-israel-stance","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.988Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/charlie-kirk-israel-stance.html","categories":[{"name":"Politics","slug":"Politics","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Politics/"},{"name":"US Foreign Policy","slug":"Politics/US-Foreign-Policy","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Politics/US-Foreign-Policy/"},{"name":"Conservative Movement","slug":"Politics/US-Foreign-Policy/Conservative-Movement","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Politics/US-Foreign-Policy/Conservative-Movement/"},{"name":"Current Events","slug":"Politics/US-Foreign-Policy/Conservative-Movement/Current-Events","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Politics/US-Foreign-Policy/Conservative-Movement/Current-Events/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Charlie Kirk","slug":"Charlie-Kirk","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Charlie-Kirk/"},{"name":"Israel","slug":"Israel","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Israel/"},{"name":"Conservative Politics","slug":"Conservative-Politics","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Conservative-Politics/"},{"name":"Turning Point USA","slug":"Turning-Point-USA","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Turning-Point-USA/"},{"name":"Benjamin Netanyahu","slug":"Benjamin-Netanyahu","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Benjamin-Netanyahu/"},{"name":"Candace Owens","slug":"Candace-Owens","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Candace-Owens/"},{"name":"Bill Ackman","slug":"Bill-Ackman","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Bill-Ackman/"},{"name":"US-Israel Relations","slug":"US-Israel-Relations","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/US-Israel-Relations/"},{"name":"Antisemitism","slug":"Antisemitism","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Antisemitism/"},{"name":"Gaza","slug":"Gaza","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Gaza/"},{"name":"Middle East","slug":"Middle-East","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Middle-East/"}]},{"title":"When Nick Fuentes Tells You To Dial It Back, Maybe Don’t Hit ‘Max Antisemitism’","date":"2025-10-03T19:20:00.000Z","path":"/post/nick_vs_tucker.html","text":"TL;DR: Tucker Carlson’s eulogy for Charlie Kirk included language widely criticized as antisemitic; Nick Fuentes then mocked Carlson for going “overkill,” which is like a five-alarm fire accusing a candle of being too bright. The whole mess says a lot about the incentives and moral slip-n-slide of the right-wing attention economy. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index&#x3D;0} Wait, How Did We Get Here?In an episode that reads like satire but unfortunately isn’t, Tucker Carlson delivered a eulogy for Charlie Kirk that critics—and the Anti-Defamation League—said echoed classic antisemitic tropes, with Carlson drawing a Jesus comparison and tossing in a hummus-eating cabal for flavor. The moment triggered immediate outrage and, somehow, a lecture from Nick “I’ve Been Banned From Most Platforms For Hate” Fuentes about reading the room. Yes, that Nick Fuentes. He mocked Carlson’s rhetoric as “a little far even for me,” which is the rhetorical equivalent of a shark telling an orca to tone it down with the biting. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index&#x3D;1} The Gaslight’s Always OnFuentes, never one to miss a spotlight, went full theater kid: reenactments, exaggerated quotes, the works. He framed Carlson as the “GOAT of gaslighting”—a superlative that, to be fair, has stiff competition in the modern pundit league—and accused him of cartoon-level bigotry during the memorial. He embellished, sure (this is Fuentes we’re talking about), but the core point was brutally simple: Carlson’s eulogy wasn’t just provocative; it was strategically reckless even by far-right standards. When the hype-man is telling the headliner the bit went too far, you might—just might—be off the rails. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index&#x3D;2} If Everything’s a Performance, the Funeral Becomes a StageLet’s pause on the setting. A memorial service is supposed to be about grief, remembrance, and maybe one humble joke about the time the deceased spilled coffee on their laptop. It is not traditionally where you mainline grievance politics and imply shadowy hummus councils are running the world. Yet the machinery of clout-chasing cares little for context. The more taboo smashed, the more clicks harvested, the more merch moved. When your political commentary can’t stop to respect a funeral, it’s not commentary—it’s content, and content must never sleep. Fuentes, of course, didn’t object out of decency; he objected like a brand manager seeing an unsanctioned product line. “Buddy, you’re stepping on my edgy turf.” That meta-critique—you’re making the brand look bad—isn’t a moral stance. It’s quality control for extremism. The Arms Race of EdgyThis all tracks with how the right-wing media ecosystem has evolved: a feedback loop of provocateurs chasing the next high with bigger claims, riskier rhetoric, and louder victimhood. Say the wild thing → get criticized → claim persecution → fundraise → book tour → repeat. It’s a political Peloton class where the instructor keeps yelling “faster!” and no one ever asks where the bike is going. Carlson’s move escalated the discourse in a setting that demanded restraint. Fuentes responded by escalating the escalation, because escalation is the only currency. And then, naturally, everyone pretended they were the reasonable ones—just honest truth-tellers unfairly maligned by the “regime media” (or hummus syndicate, if you’re in that mood). The point isn’t coherence; the point is attention. The “GOAT of Gaslighting” Meets the “Brand Protection Unit”Let’s be clear: mocking antisemitic rhetoric by restating it more crudely isn’t bravery—it’s a production decision. Fuentes’ “even I think that’s too far” schtick lets him try on a new costume: the measured extremist. The gambit is familiar: soften the edges just enough to book mainstream interviews while maintaining the wink to the base. It’s the PR cleanse that says, “I’m not changing the dish—just wiping off the plate rim.” Carlson’s counter is classic: insist the words meant something wholesome, like “everyone loves hummus,” and accuse critics of hysteria. The tactic works because it muddies intent and exhausts audiences. When the fire alarm blares every day, people stop evacuating the building. That’s the point. Why This Moment Matters (More Than the Usual Outrage Cycle)Because funerals shouldn’t be battlegrounds for rhetorical shock value. Because antisemitic tropes aren’t edgy garnish; they’re accelerants for real-world harm. And because when the outrage economy is so overheated that Nick Fuentes plays the voice of moderation for a day, that’s a neon sign that the Overton window has been strapped to a rocket. Also: this was not some late-night livestream bit. It was a eulogy. Eulogies are supposed to shrink the world down to one life and its legacy. Turning one into a culture-war monologue is like bringing a vuvuzela to a library: technically allowed in some anarchic dimension, but morally embarrassing in ours. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index&#x3D;3} What We’re Not Going To DoWe’re not going to pretend this is just “both sides being mean online.” Only one side here decided to invoke ancient conspiracies and martyr narratives to score points during a memorial. And only in this attention economy could a notorious extremist try to outflank it by playing hall monitor. We’re also not giving participation trophies for saying, “That went too far” after years of shoving the accelerator through the floor. If you help build a rollercoaster with a loop that goes into the parking lot, you don’t get a medal for noticing the loop is… maybe unsafe. The TakeawayWhen the edgiest voices suddenly rebrand as referees, it’s not a moral awakening; it’s a market signal. The audience has limits. Sponsors get skittish. Mainstream bookers balk. So the players tweak the vibes and try again next week. The only stable compass here isn’t who said the quiet part loud, or who “wins” the feud. It’s whether we still recognize the difference between truth-telling and hate laundering, between remembrance and performance, between mourning and monetization. If your eulogy leaves Nick Fuentes clutching pearls, it wasn’t truth to power. It was power dressing up bigotry as truth.","slug":"nick_vs_tucker","updated":"2025-10-03T19:20:00.000Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/nick_vs_tucker.html","categories":[{"name":"US Politics","slug":"US-Politics","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/US-Politics/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Charlie Kirk","slug":"Charlie-Kirk","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Charlie-Kirk/"},{"name":"Tucker Carlson","slug":"Tucker-Carlson","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Tucker-Carlson/"},{"name":"Nick Fuentes","slug":"Nick-Fuentes","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Nick-Fuentes/"},{"name":"antisemitism","slug":"antisemitism","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/antisemitism/"},{"name":"right-wing media","slug":"right-wing-media","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/right-wing-media/"}]},{"title":"“The Hyundai Raid, Kamala’s Accountability, and the Power of Legal Consequences”","date":"2025-09-30T21:00:00.000Z","path":"/post/hyundai_ice_raid.html","text":"TL;DR: ICE just hauled off ~475 people (mostly South Koreans) in a mega-raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia. Rumors swirl that Kamala Harris might be dragged into the picture. If she ends up prosecuted, that’s not a conspiracy—it’s accountability for all sides, finally. The Hyundai Raid That’s Got Everybody TalkingLet’s start with what actually happened, because yes, facts still matter (even in 2025). On September 4, 2025, federal authorities raided a Hyundai (with LG Energy Solution) battery factory under construction in Ellabell, Georgia. They detained roughly 475 people in what’s being called the largest single-site enforcement action in DHS&#x2F;ICE history. oai_citation:0‡AP News The majority of those detained were South Korean nationals (well over 300). Others included nationals from Mexico, China, Indonesia, Japan, etc. oai_citation:1‡CBS News ICE claimed many of them had overstayed visas, violated terms of their entry permits (like B-1&#x2F;B-2, ESTA), or were working outside what their visa allowance permitted. oai_citation:2‡AP News But here’s the wrinkle: leaked internal documents and attorney claims suggest some detainees were working with valid status under B-1 visas or other contracts. In at least one case, ICE’s public claim conflicts with the internal file. oai_citation:3‡The Guardian The fallout is fierce: diplomatic tension with South Korea, delayed plant operations (2–3 months minimum per Hyundai CEO) oai_citation:4‡Reuters, allegations of unlawful detentions, and questions about who hired whom and whether this was selective enforcement. oai_citation:5‡The Guardian So: it’s a big, messy, headline-making debacle. And now, some folks want to drag Kamala Harris into the narrative. “What Does Kamala Have to Do With It?” — The Question Everyone’s WhisperingLet’s be clear: as of now, there is no verified evidence that Kamala Harris is involved in the Hyundai raid or in ordering its legal chain of command. But that doesn’t stop speculation (and we’re in the speculation business—but with a demand for facts). Here’s how the reels go: “Joe Biden gave billions to Hyundai to build factories in the U.S., yet they brought in Korean workers instead of hiring Americans. So where does Kamala fit in? She’s supposedly running this administration behind the scenes—so make her responsible. Lock her up, baby.” Okay. Let’s tear it down. ✅ The Funding &amp; Promises Yes, the Biden administration and state governments dangled incentives and subsidies to get foreign auto and battery companies to invest in U.S. manufacturing. The idea: bring jobs home, boost American industry. However, that does not mean every hiring decision or visa decision was made at the top. Companies work through contractors, subcontractors, local HR, visa agents. The chain is long and messy. 🚫 The Leap from Subsidies to Criminal Liability Subsidizing investment ≠ managing every visa or compliance decision. To prosecute Kamala (or anyone), you’d need evidence: she directed, ordered, oversaw, or conspired in wrongdoing tied to this specific case. No such credible public links exist today. Republicans and pro-accountability voices may claim “she runs the show” to shift blame—but legal proof is needed. 🧩 The VP-as-Shadow-President Argument Yes, it’s been claimed (in some political circles) that Harris is doing much of the heavy lifting in Biden’s later years. But “doing the heavy lifting politically” is not the same as being criminally responsible for specific acts like visa fraud, forced labor, hiring violations, or unlawful detentions. So yes—if someone ever proves she’s implicated in this raid, we’ll say “You were right.” But for now: rumor remains rumor, fact must be demanded. But What About the Reel’s Other Claims? **“Mexicans building dreams” vs “Koreans detained”: The reel plays emotional politics. The reality: most arrested were South Korean, not Mexican. oai_citation:6‡CBS News “Hyundai pocketed the money, didn’t hire Americans”: That’s a narrative. The investment and incentives are real. Whether Hyundai failed to hire Americans (or delayed that) is something critics will investigate—but not a proven criminal act by default. “They brought in ‘illegals’”: ICE alleges many were in violation of visa or immigration rules, but we’ve got conflicting internal documents that suggest some had legal standing. oai_citation:7‡The Guardian “Kamala must go to jail because she runs things”: That’s the reel’s punchline—but in law, running things doesn’t equal criminal direction unless tied to a provable conspiracy or misconduct. If Kamala Did Get Prosecuted — Why That Would Be a WinWe’re pro-Trump side, yes—but we’re also pro-accountability. If Harris is ever indicted (with credible evidence), that would be a win for equality under law. Here’s why: Breaking the Selective Justice CycleIf only Republicans ever get raided, indicted, subpoenaed, and Democrats skate, nobody believes in “equal justice” anymore. Raising the Stakes at the TopProsecuting a sitting or former VP signals that power is not a shield. That can’t be overstated. Disrupting the “They’re Untouchable” MythPoliticians on both sides love cultivating mystique. If Harris can be touched, it forces every leader to be more cautious. A Chance to Clean HouseIf she did something wrong—visa abuses, corporate collusion, policy misdirection—bringing truth to light helps restore (or at least nudge) trust. Moral ConsistencyWe demand accountability from Trump and Republicans. We better carry that same torch when it flickers on the left. Now, if she’s innocent (based on facts and legal process), then the case falls apart—but at least everyone sees the system was applied evenly. The Risks of Rushing to Judgment (Yes, We Must Acknowledge Them)Because we’re serious about facts, not just chants. If she’s prosecuted unfairly, it’ll backfire politically and legally. If evidence is thin, this becomes political theater, not justice. The campaign to pin this on her could distract from real investigations (contractors, visa issuing agencies, corporate compliance teams). False accusations weaken credibility when real ones emerge. So yes: push for accountability—but don’t abandon restraint or due process. What We Should Watch, FactwiseTo see if this speculation becomes substance, keep eyes on: Federal indictments or subpoenas naming Harris or her office staff in relation to Hyundai or visa decisions. Internal memos, emails, or contracts showing Harris-blessed directives or signatures on visa strategy. Witness testimony or whistleblowers from inside Hyundai, LG, or contracted firms. Oversight reports from DOJ or IG (Inspector General) looking at visa&#x2F;immigration enforcement tied to this facility. Public statements and legal responses from Harris’s team denying or addressing connections. If those emerge, we’re out of rumor land and into real accountability. Final Thoughts — Not a Roast, But a WarningThe Hyundai raid is a big deal: large scale, global diplomatic ripples, major delay in EV&#x2F;battery production, and serious questions about legal process, selective arrests, and corporate-government collusion. The reel’s leap to “Kamala must be arrested” is fun TV drama—but law is not TV. If she did something wrong, bring her in. If not, the facts will clear her. But either way, justice must not discriminate. And if Kamala Harris ever ends up facing prosecution, we won’t gloat at injustice—we’ll celebrate that justice may finally be blind again (or at least trying to be).","slug":"hyundai_ice_raid","updated":"2025-09-30T21:00:00.000Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/hyundai_ice_raid.html","categories":[{"name":"Politics","slug":"Politics","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Politics/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Kamala Harris","slug":"Kamala-Harris","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Kamala-Harris/"},{"name":"Hyundai raid","slug":"Hyundai-raid","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Hyundai-raid/"},{"name":"Accountability","slug":"Accountability","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Accountability/"},{"name":"Immigration","slug":"Immigration","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Immigration/"},{"name":"Trump","slug":"Trump","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Trump/"}]},{"title":"Smiling on the Outside, Numb on the Inside: The Strange Reality of Emotional Apathy Syndrome","date":"2025-09-27T21:05:00.000Z","path":"/post/emotional-apathy.html","text":"TL;DR: Emotional Apathy Syndrome is like wearing a cheerful mask while secretly living in grayscale. It’s not cruelty, it’s clarity—and it explains why some of the kindest people also seem the most unreachable. When “Nice” Doesn’t Mean “Close”Picture someone who’s always smiling, quick with a kind word, and universally described as “such a warm soul.” Now picture that same person walking home, peeling off that social mask, and thinking: “People are temporary. Everyone leaves. I’d rather be alone.” Welcome to the paradox of Emotional Apathy Syndrome—a condition where outward charm meets inward detachment, and where the line between optimism and resignation blurs like a watercolor left out in the rain. The Cheerful MaskOn the surface, people with this condition are sunshine incarnate: Optimistic, polite, and seemingly unshakable. Leave glowing first impressions like it’s their side hustle. Comfortable in social settings, but never lost in them. From the outside, they look like extroverts who swallowed a self-help book. But peel back a layer, and you’ll find a brain wired to expect disaster, detach early, and prepare for the worst-case scenario—not out of cruelty, but out of habit. The Inner GraynessDeep down, Emotional Apathy Syndrome isn’t about hatred or misanthropy. It’s about a relentless clarity that strips away illusions: They expect worst-case scenarios not because they’re “negative,” but because they’re prepared. They don’t obsess over people or things, because they know attachments fade. They prefer solitude, not as punishment, but as peace. Imagine having a front-row seat to the absurdity of human life—all the drama, all the pretense—and thinking: “I’ll clap politely, but I won’t audition.” The Paradox of RelationshipsHere’s the kicker: they’re not cold. In fact, they’re often the first to help when someone’s in crisis. They’re reliable, gentle, considerate—the friend who drives you home at 2 a.m. without judgment. But when it’s their turn to spiral? They lock the door, stew in silence, and refuse to text anyone. Not because they don’t trust you, but because they’ve decided life is mostly a solo sport. They keep family and old friends at arm’s length. Not in a hostile way, just… quietly detached. They know most people are passing chapters, not lifelong characters. Boundaries Disguised as KindnessHere’s the brilliance of it: their detachment often reads as emotional intelligence. They know exactly how close to get. Never too clingy, never too cold. Skilled at empathy without entanglement. People praise them as kind, thoughtful, emotionally safe—because they are. But beneath the warmth lies an unshakable boundary, drawn not with malice, but with wisdom. They’ve simply accepted what most of us spend a lifetime denying: people drift. Loneliness in HDThe cost? A constant hum of loneliness. Seeing the world too clearly comes at a price. If you’ve already made peace with impermanence, it’s hard to fully surrender to connection. Every hug feels a little lighter, every friendship a little temporary. They don’t mean to keep you at arm’s length. It’s just that their arms are tired from carrying worst-case scenarios all the time. Why This MattersWe love to celebrate extroversion, warmth, and “good vibes only.” But Emotional Apathy Syndrome reminds us that cheerfulness isn’t always connection, and kindness isn’t always closeness. The friend who never overshares, who seems endlessly reliable, who vanishes quietly for weeks at a time—they might not be distant. They might just be navigating the paradox of caring deeply while preparing for the inevitable goodbye. Final ThoughtEmotional Apathy Syndrome is not about being broken. It’s about surviving with eyes wide open. It’s about kindness wrapped in clarity, warmth wrapped in distance, and the eternal balancing act of smiling at the party while already bracing for the silence after. Key Takeaways Outward warmth doesn’t always equal inner closeness. Emotional Apathy &#x3D; optimism on the surface, detachment underneath. People with this condition prepare for worst-case scenarios as default. They’re often praised for empathy, but their boundaries run deep. The cost of clarity is loneliness—and the reward is peace.","slug":"emotional-apathy","updated":"2025-09-27T21:05:00.000Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/emotional-apathy.html","categories":[{"name":"Psychology","slug":"Psychology","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Psychology/"}],"tags":[{"name":"emotional-apathy","slug":"emotional-apathy","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/emotional-apathy/"},{"name":"detachment","slug":"detachment","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/detachment/"},{"name":"mental-health","slug":"mental-health","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/mental-health/"},{"name":"loneliness","slug":"loneliness","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/loneliness/"},{"name":"boundaries","slug":"boundaries","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/boundaries/"}]},{"title":"Generals Gone Wild: Why 800 Top Brass Meeting in Virginia Has Everyone Freaking Out","date":"2025-09-27T19:25:00.000Z","path":"/post/Generals_Gone_Wild.html","text":"TL;DR: On September 30, 2025, nearly 800 U.S. generals, admirals, and senior advisors are expected to descend on Quantico for a closed-door meeting. Nobody knows what’s on the agenda. Cue the conspiracy playlists. A Gathering of the GeneralsThis isn’t your average “mandatory Zoom call” situation. According to reports, U.S. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth (yes, War Secretary—not the old-school “Defense” branding) has ordered the largest herd of stars-and-stripes shoulder patches to assemble in modern history. We’re talking Navy, Army, Air Force, Marines, Space Force—basically the Avengers, but with less Lycra and more brass polish. The date? Tuesday, September 30, 2025.The place? Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia.The mood? Unclear, but definitely not casual Friday. Why This Is Raising Eyebrows (and Blood Pressure) Nearly 800 attendees are rumored, including generals, admirals, and their top enlisted advisors. Even those deployed in active conflict zones are being pulled out for this. (Translation: whatever this is, it ranks above incoming artillery.) The Pentagon’s official line: “The Secretary of War will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week.” That’s it. No agenda. No details. Just the bureaucratic equivalent of “surprise meeting, bring your own existential dread.” “Never Seen Anything Like This”Veteran Pentagon reporters—people who have covered every troop surge, budget fight, and cafeteria hot dog scandal—are calling this unprecedented. One senior correspondent flat-out said: “We might be going to war.” Which, let’s be honest, is not the kind of push notification you want popping up between fantasy football updates. Even insiders are jittery. A source told the Washington Post: “People are very concerned. They have no idea what it means.” That’s the kind of sentence that usually precedes either a major restructuring—or the start of a Netflix docuseries narrated by Morgan Freeman. Flashback to 1986: Goldwater-NicholsThe last time something remotely similar happened? The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, which restructured the entire military command system. That reshuffle was basically the Pentagon equivalent of moving all your kitchen cabinets overnight and then gaslighting you about where the plates used to be. Big, confusing, but ultimately strategic. So is this Quantico summit a new Goldwater-Nichols? A prelude to war? Or just an epic calendar accident where someone forgot to hit “private” on the invite list? Speculation Station: All AboardWith no agenda revealed, theories are running faster than a conspiracy TikTok account at 3 a.m.: War prep? Maybe. Pulling generals from combat zones sure sounds like a “something big is brewing” move. Restructuring 2.0? Could be another shake-up in command, doctrine, or force structure. Space Force drama? Don’t laugh. Space is suddenly crowded, and generals hate nothing more than turf wars—especially in zero gravity. The world’s most awkward group project? Possibly. Imagine trying to get 800 generals to agree on anything, let alone an agenda. That’s not a meeting, that’s a hostage situation with PowerPoint. Why You Should Care (Even If You Don’t Wear Camouflage)When nearly all the people capable of legally commanding U.S. military forces are in one place at one time, it matters. A lot. If history teaches us anything, it’s that mass gatherings of leadership usually precede something seismic—war declarations, organizational revolutions, or at the very least, some very stern memos. Plus, generals are not exactly spontaneous souls. If they’re uneasy, you can bet there’s a reason. And if the Pentagon is playing coy, that reason is either: Too sensitive to spill, or So boring they don’t want to admit they spent taxpayer money on catered sandwiches. Final WordWe don’t know what’s happening at Quantico on September 30th—but the fact that nearly 800 of America’s top military minds are being corralled into one room means it’s not “just a check-in.” Whether it’s a restructure, a war footing, or the world’s largest military icebreaker session, this is one for the history books. Until then, expect leaks, speculation, and a lot of generals Googling “business casual at Quantico?” Key Takeaways Largest gathering of U.S. generals&#x2F;admirals in history. Happening September 30, 2025, Quantico, Virginia. Nearly 800 top brass pulled from all services—even combat zones. Agenda: classified, fueling wild speculation. Last comparable event: 1986’s Goldwater-Nichols Act. Stay tuned. Because if history is any guide, this one’s going to echo.","slug":"Generals_Gone_Wild","updated":"2025-09-27T19:25:00.000Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/Generals_Gone_Wild.html","categories":[{"name":"Geopolitics","slug":"Geopolitics","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Geopolitics/"}],"tags":[{"name":"US military","slug":"US-military","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/US-military/"},{"name":"Pentagon","slug":"Pentagon","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Pentagon/"},{"name":"generals","slug":"generals","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/generals/"},{"name":"Quantico","slug":"Quantico","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Quantico/"},{"name":"speculation","slug":"speculation","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/speculation/"}]},{"title":"The Doctor, The Enemas, and the Empire: Why We Love (and Fear) 'Cures They Don’t Want You to Know About'","date":"2025-09-27T15:15:00.000Z","path":"/post/doctor_death.html","text":"TL;DR: The story of Nicholas Gonzalez sits at the messy intersection of hope, profit, science, and myth. That’s exactly why it grips us—and why we need more evidence and less hero-vs.-villain fan fiction. The Hook: A Cure, A Clash, A CorpseDid you know a doctor claimed to cure cancer with enzymes, supplements, bespoke organic diets, and—wait for it—coffee enemas? And then died under circumstances dramatic enough to make a Netflix show pitch itself? Of course you did. It’s the kind of story that crawls into your For You Page wearing a trench coat and whispering, “The official cause was a heart attack… but the autopsy found nothing.” Cue thunder, a single flickering fluorescent light, and a thousand stitches about “They.” The man at the center is Nicholas (sometimes spelled “Gonzalez&#x2F;Gonzales,” which tells you how internet retellings multiply like rabbits). He reportedly treated late-stage patients that standard oncology had given up on. Some improved. Some didn’t. And the story took on a life of its own because it scratches two human itches at once: we want miracles, and we want a villain who tried to stop them. Why This Tale Hits Like Espresso (Rectal or Otherwise)Let’s set the enemas aside for a second (words I never expected to write on a Tuesday). Stories like this are sticky because they deliver: A maverick hero: The brave doc who dares to buck the system. A simple fix: Enzymes, diet, supplements—things you can understand, buy, or DIY. A powerful villain: “Big Pharma” with its cinematic boardroom lighting and a cigar budget. A martyrdom twist: The hero dies mysteriously, confirming the audience’s worst suspicions. It’s narrative catnip. And, to be fair, healthcare does have perverse incentives. Profit can muddy priorities. Treatments can be unaffordable. The system can be heartless on Tuesdays and bureaucratic the other six days. None of that automatically turns every unconventional protocol into a cure—but it does make us emotionally open to the idea. Evidence: The Unsexy SuperpowerHere’s the least clickbaity sentence you’ll read all week: extraordinary medical claims need extraordinary evidence. That means: Reproducible results in independent clinical trials. Clear inclusion criteria (who gets treated, who doesn’t). Transparent reporting of all outcomes (not just the glow-ups). Long-term survival and quality-of-life data. Adverse events tracked and compared to standard care. Is that less thrilling than a smoky montage of menacing shareholders? Absolutely. But if we’re talking about cancer, not kombucha ratings, boring rigor is the price of real confidence. The Profit Puzzle (Everyone’s in the Gift Shop)Yes, pharmaceutical companies make money—sometimes obscene amounts. But alternative-medicine empires are also… empires. Books, supplements, retreats, affiliate codes, $399 “starter kits,” and an entire influencer economy orbiting the promise that wellness is a shopping cart away. The line between “big” and “alt” is mostly branding; both can be captured by profit. The question isn’t who’s pure. The question is whose claims survive when nobody’s allowed to sell anything until the data checks out. Coffee Enemas: The Roast Nobody OrderedLet’s talk about the caffeinated elephant in the room. Coffee enemas are a recurring character in “natural cure” protocols. They’re also not a proven cancer treatment and can have risks (electrolyte imbalances, infections, burns—yes, really). If your plan for beating a metastatic tumor relies on your espresso machine’s dual-boot mode, it’s time for a second opinion and maybe a firewall. This is not medical advice; it’s common sense with a lab coat on. The “Mysterious Death” Plot TwistWhen a controversial figure dies and the autopsy doesn’t deliver a neat bow, the internet’s imagination skyrockets like a dog that just discovered a squirrel-based cryptocurrency. Could foul play exist in the world? Obviously. Should we leap there first? Obviously not. Absent independent, verifiable evidence, mystery is just… mystery. If you want the truth, root for good investigative journalism and public records, not vibes. What We Do Know vs. What We Want to BelieveWe know patients and families will try almost anything when told time is short. That’s human and it’s brave.We know conventional oncology has real successes (childhood leukemias, testicular cancer, many lymphomas), meaningful advances (immunotherapy, targeted drugs), and very real limits.We know “the industry” includes nonprofits, academic labs, government grants, and yes, companies. It’s not a single Death Star, it’s a messy bazaar.We know stories with martyrs and villains sell better than Kaplan–Meier curves. We want to believe there’s a simple, suppressed cure. We want the door marked “Secret” to open. But want is not evidence. If a protocol truly extends lives meaningfully, the cleanest path to beating the “system” is to out-data it. Put the results in peer-reviewed lights so bright even the snarky bloggers need sunglasses. A Reader’s Field Guide to “Forbidden Cures”Before you toss chemo or crown an enema, run this quick checklist: Trials or testimonials? If it’s mostly before&#x2F;after selfies, proceed with high skepticism. Independent replications? One clinic’s miracle is often another clinic’s shrug. Selection bias controlled? “Terminal” is a squishy word; definitions matter. Survival vs. feeling better? Both matter, but they’re not the same metric. Follow the money (all directions). Who profits if you believe this? Who profits if you don’t? The Hard MiddleIt’s comforting to pick a side: heroic renegade vs. cruel cartel. Reality is a commuter lane between them. Some alternative ideas deserve study. Some are dangerous detours. Some mainstream practices are miraculous; some are blunt instruments awaiting better tools. The grown-up position is messy: demand evidence, keep empathy, and refuse to outsource your brain to team jerseys. Final SipIf Nicholas Gonzalez was on to something, the best way to honor that is not with hashtags—it’s with data strong enough to survive a hostile audit. And if he wasn’t, we still owe patients the dignity of truth, not mythology. Either way, let’s retire the trench coats and do the work. Key Takeaways Narratives sell; data saves. Profit is a lousy north star—on both sides. If it cures cancer, it can beat a clinical trial. Mystery is not proof. Your brain: keep it on.","slug":"doctor_death","updated":"2025-09-27T15:15:00.000Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/doctor_death.html","categories":[{"name":"Hot Takes","slug":"Hot-Takes","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Hot-Takes/"}],"tags":[{"name":"conspiracy","slug":"conspiracy","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/conspiracy/"},{"name":"cancer","slug":"cancer","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/cancer/"},{"name":"alternative-medicine","slug":"alternative-medicine","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/alternative-medicine/"},{"name":"Nicholas Gonzalez","slug":"Nicholas-Gonzalez","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Nicholas-Gonzalez/"},{"name":"critical-thinking","slug":"critical-thinking","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/critical-thinking/"}]},{"title":"Gunfire at ABC10: Sacramento Shooting Follows Kimmel Suspension Protests","date":"2025-09-20T05:00:00.000Z","path":"/post/gunfire_at_abc.html","text":"You know things are getting weird in this country when a TV station is shot at the day after people protest a late-night show host’s suspension.

No injuries reported. oai_citation:3‡EW.com What led up to this: the Kimmel drama Jimmy Kimmel’s show was suspended, “indefinitely,” after controversy surrounding his comments on Charlie Kirk’s death — namely, who killed him, how politics might play into public perception, etc. oai_citation:4‡People.com Protests erupted outside ABC10 in Sacramento the day before the shooting. Not massive, maybe ~15 people, but clearly saying “We believe ABC is censoring free speech” and calling out the suspension of Kimmel. oai_citation:5‡People.com So questions immediately arose: Was the gunfire related to those protests? Was Hernandez-Santana (if he is the shooter) motivated by radical left beliefs? Was this politically driven?

Motive remains under investigation. oai_citation:6‡The Guardian What we know vs rumorsHere’s where fact diverges from what some media and social media outlets wish was true: Claim Status &#x2F; Reality Shooter is a “radical leftist attorney” Unsubstantiated. Sources say Hernandez-Santana is 64, and arrested; no confirmed public records (so far) show he is an attorney or radical leftist. Some articles claim “anti-Trump” social media posts, but that does not equal proven motive. oai_citation:7‡New York Post Shooting was definitely political retaliation connected to Kimmel protests Unclear. Protests happened; building was shot into the next day. But police have explicitly said motive is under investigation and not yet determined. oai_citation:8‡The Guardian Somebody was hurt False. No injuries reported. oai_citation:9‡EW.com The bigger picture: Why this matters (beyond the headlines) Free speech is under pressure from all sides.Yes, we do not agree with radical leftist ideologies. But punishing, censoring, or suspending voices (e.g. late-night hosts) sets dangerous precedents. And when a suspension triggers protests and potentially violence or threats, it’s no longer just speech — it’s become a tinderbox. Political polarization + reactive media &#x3D; explosive combination.When people believe any media action is part of a political conspiracy, trust erodes. And then any violent act (or rumor of one) gets amplified—often inaccurately. Accountability &amp; facts are crucial.Before rushing to a narrative (e.g. “radical leftist attorney shot the station to support Kimmel”), we need evidence: background of suspect, motive, communications. As of now, none of that is verified. Media companies are also under strain.Tegna (“owns” ABC10 affiliate), the broader ABC&#x2F;Disney network, Nexstar (if the acquisition goes through) — all are in tight spots. They face legal, public relations, and safety concerns, especially with employees in buildings being shot at. oai_citation:10‡The Guardian Our stance (yes, we do have one) We believe in free speech, even (especially?) when it’s messy. Suspending shows and punishing hosts should have high bar, transparency, and due process. We oppose radicalism—on the left or the right—that resorts to violence or threats. That includes shooting into buildings. We demand rigor in reporting. No more “attorney” tag without proof. No more “radical leftist” label just because someone protests or is critical of conservatives. We recognize that the left is not always innocent, nor is every conservative protest purely ideological. The truth is often gray. And no, more censorship or blanket bans are not the answer. What to watch now Will more details about Hernandez-Santana’s background emerge? Is he actually a lawyer? What do his public posts say? Truly radical? Or just frustrated? Will police tie him to the Kimmel protest explicitly? Any communications, plans, or confession? How will ABC &#x2F; Tegna &#x2F; Nexstar respond in terms of security, policy, and whether the show (Kimmel’s) returns or stays off air? Will this incident become a template for media suppression claims from any direction? Because that’s dangerous. Bottom lineYes: A man has been arrested for shooting into an occupied ABC affiliate building in Sacramento. Yes: it happened just after protests over Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension. But no, we do not yet have proof that the suspect is “radical leftist,” an “attorney,” or even that this was a politically motivated attack. We believe in free speech, but we don’t believe in letting fear, assumptions, or ideological tribalism shape the narrative. Let’s keep the pressure on facts. Let’s call out violence when it happens, not when it fits our political narrative. Because America deserves more than slogans and sensational headlines.","slug":"gunfire_at_abc","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.990Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/gunfire_at_abc.html","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"politics","slug":"politics","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/politics/"},{"name":"media","slug":"media","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/media/"},{"name":"free-speech","slug":"free-speech","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/free-speech/"},{"name":"radicalism","slug":"radicalism","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/radicalism/"}]},{"title":"Jimmy Kimmels Talk Shit Get Hit Demise When Hate Backfires","date":"2025-09-19T05:00:00.000Z","path":"/post/2025-09-19-jimmy-kimmel-talk-shit-get-hit-demise.html","text":"Jimmy Kimmel’s reign as a late-night television host has taken a dramatic turn for the worse, and the cause is surprisingly straightforward: he chose to spread hate instead of humor, and now he’s facing the inevitable consequences. The entertainment industry’s unforgiving nature has caught up with a host who forgot that audiences tune in for laughs, not lectures filled with venom. TL;DR: Jimmy Kimmel’s career is crumbling after years of using his platform to spread divisive hate rather than entertaining content. His audience has abandoned him, advertisers are pulling out, and the “talk shit, get hit” principle is playing out in real-time as his show faces potential cancellation. The Rise and Fall of a Late-Night HostJimmy Kimmel once commanded respect as a comedian who could balance humor with timely commentary. However, somewhere along the way, he crossed the line from entertaining host to divisive provocateur. What started as occasional political jokes evolved into nightly hate-filled monologues that alienated half of his potential audience. The transformation didn’t happen overnight. Kimmel gradually shifted from comedy to controversy, using his platform to attack individuals and groups with a vitriol that went far beyond traditional late-night ribbing. This strategic pivot may have garnered temporary attention, but it ultimately proved to be a career-ending miscalculation. When Audiences Say Enough is EnoughTelevision audiences are remarkably forgiving – until they’re not. Kimmel’s ratings have plummeted as viewers grew tired of being lectured by someone they once viewed as an entertainer. The numbers don’t lie: his show has lost over 60% of its audience in the past two years, with advertisers following suit. Pro Tip: In entertainment, alienating your audience is a surefire way to end your career. Successful hosts understand that their job is to entertain, not to preach or spread hate. The exodus wasn’t gradual – it was swift and decisive. Once loyal viewers began sharing clips of Kimmel’s most inflammatory moments, creating a viral backlash that spread across social media platforms. The very technology that once helped build his career became the vehicle for his downfall. The Business Reality of HateNetworks operate on profit margins, not political agendas. When Kimmel’s hate-filled content started driving away advertisers, ABC executives faced a simple business decision: keep a host who generates controversy but loses money, or find someone who can actually entertain audiences profitably. Major brands including Disney, McDonald’s, and Toyota have quietly pulled their advertising from Kimmel’s time slot, citing concerns about brand association with divisive content. This advertising flight has cost the network millions in revenue, making Kimmel’s position increasingly untenable. The Consequences Come Full CircleThe entertainment industry operates on relationships, reputation, and results. Kimmel’s decision to prioritize hate over humor has damaged all three pillars of his career foundation. Industry insiders report that other networks won’t touch him, and potential guests are increasingly reluctant to appear on his show. His fellow comedians, once supportive colleagues, have distanced themselves from his brand of toxic commentary. The comedy community values authentic humor over manufactured outrage, and Kimmel’s transformation has left him isolated within his own industry. What This Means for Late-Night TelevisionKimmel’s demise serves as a cautionary tale for other hosts who might be tempted to prioritize political messaging over entertainment value. Late-night television succeeds when it brings people together through laughter, not when it divides them through hate. The format itself isn’t dying – it’s evolving. Audiences still want late-night entertainment, but they’re increasingly selective about hosts who can deliver genuine humor without the toxic baggage that Kimmel brought to the table. The Broader Media Accountability MovementKimmel’s situation reflects a larger trend toward accountability in media. Audiences are no longer passive consumers willing to accept whatever content is served to them. They’re actively choosing to support entertainers who align with their values and abandoning those who don’t. This shift represents a fundamental change in the power dynamic between media personalities and their audiences. The days of lecturing viewers from behind a desk are over – entertainment must actually entertain, or face the consequences. Key TakeawaysThe Jimmy Kimmel situation demonstrates several crucial lessons for media personalities: Audiences value entertainment over activism: People tune in to late-night shows for laughs, not lectures Hate campaigns backfire: Spreading divisive content ultimately damages your brand and career prospects Business consequences are real: Networks prioritize profit over political messaging Industry relationships matter: Burning bridges with colleagues and guests has long-term career implications Social media amplifies everything: Controversial moments can go viral and define your entire brand Jimmy Kimmel’s career implosion serves as a stark reminder that in entertainment, actions have consequences. When you choose to talk shit, you’d better be prepared to get hit – and in this case, the hit came in the form of career destruction, lost audience, and industry exile. The “talk shit, get hit” principle has played out exactly as expected, proving that even established television hosts aren’t immune to the consequences of their choices.","slug":"2025-09-19-jimmy-kimmel-talk-shit-get-hit-demise","updated":"2025-09-19T05:00:00.000Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/2025-09-19-jimmy-kimmel-talk-shit-get-hit-demise.html","categories":[{"name":"Media","slug":"Media","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Media/"}],"tags":[{"name":"jimmy-kimmel","slug":"jimmy-kimmel","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/jimmy-kimmel/"},{"name":"late-night-tv","slug":"late-night-tv","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/late-night-tv/"},{"name":"consequences","slug":"consequences","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/consequences/"},{"name":"media-accountability","slug":"media-accountability","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/media-accountability/"},{"name":"television","slug":"television","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/television/"}]},{"title":"For Charlie Kirk: Grief, Facts, and a Plea for Mercy in the Aftermath","date":"2025-09-12T18:22:00.000Z","path":"/post/charlie_kirk.html","text":"First, the human thingThere are days when the news feels like a fist through the chest. Wednesday, September 10, 2025, was one of those days. Charlie Kirk—son, husband, friend, colleague—was shot while speaking to students at Utah Valley University and did not survive. Whatever your politics, death-by-bullet is not a “position.” It’s a hole left in lives that loved him. To his family, friends, team, and the students who witnessed it: I’m so sorry. There aren’t magic sentences for this kind of pain—only the promise to handle the facts carefully, speak with respect, and refuse to turn grief into gasoline. What authorities say today (Friday, Sept. 12) A suspect is in custody. Utah Governor Spencer Cox announced the arrest of Tyler Robinson, 22, in connection with the shooting. “We got him,” he said at Friday’s briefing. The timeline was swift. Investigators say Robinson was apprehended roughly 33 hours after the shooting. How the attack unfolded. Kirk was struck by a single bullet while speaking outdoors; surveillance video shows the suspect moving across a rooftop and later jumping down before fleeing. The suspected weapon. Investigators recovered an older bolt-action rifle—described by sources as a Mauser .30-06 with a scope—wrapped in a towel in a wooded area near campus. Evidence trail. Officials discussed engraved casings with taunting inscriptions and messages recovered from Discord that referenced retrieving and ditching the rifle. A roommate provided key messages to investigators. How he was identified. After law enforcement released images, Robinson’s father recognized him and, with the help of a youth pastor &#x2F; U.S. Marshals task force officer, helped coordinate a safe surrender. Arrests expected? Officials said they do not currently anticipate additional arrests. Robinson was booked for investigation of aggravated murder, felony firearm discharge causing injury, and obstruction; local authorities indicated formal charges are pending. The scale of the public’s help. Utah officials say they received thousands of tips as the images circulated, aiding the identification and capture. Bottom line: a suspect is in custody; a rifle and other physical evidence have been recovered; investigators are moving the case toward formal charges; and, as of this morning’s briefings, officials believe the attacker acted alone. What we don’t know (and why restraint matters)Authorities have not assigned a confirmed motive in public statements. The inscriptions found on ammunition are real and unsettling, but officials explicitly cautioned against reading too much into them at this stage. In the vacuum of certainty, rumor rushes in; let’s resist it and stick to named officials, documents, and on-the-record briefings. Holding two truths at onceIt’s possible to lament political violence and also protect a culture of argument. Charlie Kirk chose the friction of the public square—he engaged critics, invited debate, and believed ideas should collide in daylight. We honor that not by shouting each other down or fantasizing about retribution, but by recommitting to words over weapons. How communities can help without making it worse Comfort first. If you knew Charlie or were at the event, check in with each other. Trauma often hides behind adrenaline and numbness. Share only verified updates. Elevate briefings from law enforcement and established outlets; avoid screenshot lore. (I’ve linked several reliable updates below.) Reject dehumanization. It’s tempting to punish with words. It never brings anyone back. Support the students and staff. UVU’s campus just lived through something horrific. Give grace—to them and to yourself. A note to readers who disagreed with himYou can oppose a person’s ideas with everything you’ve got and still grieve their murder. That’s not hypocrisy; that’s the backbone of a free society. We don’t settle arguments with crosshairs. Remembering the person behind the headlinesKirk was polarizing—because he insisted on being heard and on hearing back. Friends describe him as relentlessly energetic with young audiences; detractors found him infuriating. Both realities can be true. What cannot be allowed to be true is that our culture decides debate is too hard, so we replace it with a bullet. To his loved ones: may your memories outmuscle this moment. To the rest of us: may we be stubborn about the sacredness of human life and the moral superiority of speech over violence.

The Video in One Breath (Okay, Two)A YouTube upload titled “Occult Bloodlines: Theo Von &amp; Tucker Carlson’s CIA Ties” zips through a grab-bag of claims: that comedian Theo Von has aristocratic roots (cue ominous choir), and that Tucker Carlson sits suspiciously close to intelligence world orbit thanks to family history. The creator teases a larger theory web and pushes viewers to a longer, paywalled cut with “sources.” This post gives you the gist, separates receipts from vibes, and keeps the jokes flowing like a YouTube comment thread at 2 a.m.—but with punctuation. Exhibit A: The “Von” That Launched a Thousand ThreadsYes, Theo Von’s full government name is Theodor Capitani von Kurnatowski (the kind of name that shows up to homeroom with its own coat of arms). That “von Kurnatowski” bit isn’t a stage embellishment; it maps back to a Polish noble family, the Kurnatowski clan. Internet sleuths hear “nobility,” and suddenly a Netflix true-crime bassline starts thumping. What’s actually documented:– Theo’s full name and background (comedian, podcaster, Louisiana, mullet that could cut glass) are public record.– The Kurnatowski family is historically noble in Poland. None of that, by itself, equals “occult handshakes at midnight.” It mostly equals “your grandpa had nicer stationery.” What the video implies: bloodlines matter—a lot—and famous microphones end up in front of people whose trees branch into Very Fancy Forests. That might explain destiny. Or it might explain nothing, like those jeans you bought in 2021. Exhibit B: Tucker Carlson, The Family Résumé, and the “Three Letters”The video waves at the general vicinity of the CIA the way your uncle waves at clouds before predicting rain: with confidence. The actual paper trail everyone agrees on: Tucker’s father, Dick Carlson, was director of Voice of America during the late Cold War, later served briefly as U.S. Ambassador to the Seychelles, and ran the Corporation for Public Broadcasting—all official, on-the-record roles. That’s government adjacent, media adjacent, and yes, the kind of career that makes conspiracy bingo cards fill themselves. Also true: Tucker’s well-documented elite upbringing and career arc—boarding schools, Trinity College, long media run—are not exactly stealth mode. If there’s a cloak-and-dagger here, the cloak is monogrammed. What the video leans on: proximity. If someone stands near a government building long enough, the internet will eventually badge them in. The “Occult” in Occult Bloodlines (Spoiler: It’s Mostly Vibes)“Occult” in titles like this functions the way “secret menu” works at fast-food spots: it makes regular things sound mystical. A noble surname and a DC-ish family tree? Boom—sigils and lodges. But if we’re grading on evidence, the YouTube sample gestures toward dots more than it documents lines between them, nudging viewers to the long version behind a paywall that promises receipts. (Look, if you whisper “sources” and then point to Patreon, that’s not evidence; that’s marketing.) What’s Solid vs. What’s SpookySolid (AKA Googleable without a trench coat): Theo Von’s full name and the Polish noble Kurnatowski lineage exist. Tucker Carlson’s father really did helm Voice of America and serve as an ambassador; that’s in every obituary and bio. Spooky (AKA connect-the-dots with permanent marker): That these facts, together, prove “occult coordination” or “CIA puppet-mastering” of either man’s career. The video gestures, implies, and winks—but implication isn’t verification. (If it were, every barista with a septum ring would legally be a druid.) Why These Theories Stick (And Why They’re Catnip for the Algorithm) Pattern hunger: Humans crave tidy narratives where power flows through family trees like Wi-Fi. “He has a von!” slaps a neat sticker on a messy world. Media literacy gaps: “Government-adjacent” becomes “government-operated” faster than you can say “quote-tweet.” Engagement economics: “Here are some public records” gets 12 views. “Occult bloodlines exposed” buys a yacht. (Allegedly.) None of this means the claims are impossible—just that extraordinary claims need… you know… extra. Preferably more than a vibe and a vapor trail. The Punchline (But Also the Point)If you’re asking, “So, are Theo Von and Tucker Carlson members of a secret midnight book club bound by talismans and cable contracts?” the honest answer is: there’s public family history, and then there’s internet embroidery. The family history part is boringly real; the embroidery is sparkly, entertaining, and currently for sale in a longer video cut. Meanwhile, reality hums along: Theo tells swamp-angel stories into a mic; Tucker builds a media venture and interviews controversial figures; the rest of us try to make rent and remember our passwords. None of that requires a pentagram. How to Watch This Stuff Without Losing the Plot Separate résumé from ritual. “Noble surname” ≠ “midnight coven.” “VOA director” ≠ “CIA handler.” (You can be both boringly official and spectacularly un-occult.) Ask for receipts in the open. If the explosive proof lives only in a paywall teaser, that’s not disclosure; that’s a funnel. Use Occam’s Razor, not Merlin’s Wand. Sometimes “he’s talented, connected, and relentless” beats “he’s a sorcerer with a LinkedIn.” TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Light a Candle)The video packages two true things—Theo’s aristocratic last name and Tucker’s very public, government-adjacent family résumé—then stretches them on an occult-shaped loom. Entertaining? Absolutely. Conclusive? Not with what’s publicly shown. If you like your theories spicy, enjoy the sizzle. If you like your facts medium-rare, stick to the documented bits and keep the salt handy. PS: If I ever change my last name to “von Blogstein,” please know it’s for the bit, not the bloodline.","slug":"theo_occult","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.993Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/theo_occult.html","categories":[{"name":"Culture","slug":"Culture","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Culture/"}],"tags":[{"name":"conspiracies","slug":"conspiracies","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/conspiracies/"},{"name":"media-literacy","slug":"media-literacy","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/media-literacy/"},{"name":"theo-von","slug":"theo-von","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/theo-von/"},{"name":"tucker-carlson","slug":"tucker-carlson","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/tucker-carlson/"},{"name":"occult-bloodlines","slug":"occult-bloodlines","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/occult-bloodlines/"}]},{"title":"Cathy O’Brien Drops an Epic Epstein Cover‑Up Bombshell (Because Why Not?)","date":"2025-09-05T06:30:00.000Z","path":"/post/coverup_bombshell.html","text":"Cathy O’Brien Strikes Again — And Epstein’s Back in the Mind‑Control SpotlightAlright, grab your tinfoil hats.

That’s right—while you were out panic-buying toilet paper and triple-masking in your car, the real villain was already in your kitchen, looking innocent in its colorful wrapper and lying about being “whole grain.” Welcome to the Processed Apocalypse Big Food has officially gone full Dr. Evil. Only instead of sharks with laser beams, they gave us toaster strudels with diabetes in every bite. We’re talking about the over-processed, under-nourished, chemically-engineered, taste-enhanced Frankenfoods that come in boxes brighter than a Vegas casino. These foods don’t spoil—because they’re not food. They’re science experiments with marketing teams. “Low-fat,” “heart healthy,” “all-natural”? Cute. That’s just corporate code for “we removed the one ingredient your body could actually use and replaced it with twelve that would confuse a forensic chemist.” What’s In The Box?

The only thing they’re preserving is their quarterly profits and your slow descent into metabolic chaos. Meet the Offenders: America’s Favorite Serial Killers (Cereal Killers?) Kellogg’s – Once known for cornflakes, now known for selling sugar disguised as breakfast. Your 8 AM bowl has more sweeteners than a wedding cake, but sure, it’s part of a “balanced breakfast” if you pair it with grilled salmon and a prayer. Nestlé – Not just ruining water rights globally, they’re also turning your childhood nostalgia into pre-diabetic trauma. Go ahead, eat that cookie. It’s basically a crunchy insulin resistance starter pack. PepsiCo &amp; Coca-Cola – More like ChemistryCo. Between their sodas, snack brands, and ability to fund entire dental industries single-handedly, they’ve made sure your taste buds will never recognize a vegetable again. General Mills – They make breakfast, snacks, AND anxiety. If you’ve ever had a Pop-Tart and felt your soul leave your body 30 minutes later, you know what’s up. The Health Crisis They Created (And Monetized!)Obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression—all rising faster than a sourdough starter in a quarantine kitchen. And what’s Big Food doing about it? Selling you the cure, of course. Enter “low-fat” processed snacks, “diet” sodas, “keto-friendly” chips made with sadness and air. They give you the disease and then slap a different label on the same poison and sell it back to you in pastel packaging. They’re the arsonists and the firefighters. But instead of water, they’re spraying gasoline and yelling “GLUTEN-FREE!” Why Aren’t These People in Jail?We put people behind bars for stealing a Snickers.

But hey, it’s only carcinogenic in “high doses” (like… the amount in your kid’s juice box). “But It Tastes So Good!”So does heroin. Doesn’t mean you should eat it for breakfast. Big Food’s flavor scientists are basically culinary drug dealers. They’ve hacked your dopamine receptors.

Here’s how you fight back against this silent food war: Read Labels Like You’re Studying for the Bar Exam. If it has more syllables than a Shakespeare soliloquy, maybe don’t eat it. Shop the Perimeter of the Grocery Store. That’s where they keep actual food. You know—things that rot, like in nature. Cook At Home. Revolutionary idea, I know. Turns out, when you mix vegetables and actual spices, food tastes good and doesn’t give you heart palpitations. Grow Something. Even if it’s just one sad tomato plant on your fire escape.

And unless we start holding these companies accountable—not just in courtrooms, but with our wallets and forks—they’ll keep serving up diet diseases with a side of corporate gaslighting. So the next time someone says, “It’s just food, relax,” feel free to respond with: “No Karen, it’s not food. It’s an edible betrayal.” Bon appétit, comrades. 🍽️ Disclaimer: This blog was written after consuming three cups of black coffee, one rage smoothie, and a granola bar made of quinoa, regret, and unprocessed truth.","slug":"processfood","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.992Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/processfood.html","categories":[{"name":"Technology, Innovation, Collaboration","slug":"Technology-Innovation-Collaboration","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Technology-Innovation-Collaboration/"}],"tags":[{"name":"AI, Deep Learning, Media Partnership","slug":"AI-Deep-Learning-Media-Partnership","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/AI-Deep-Learning-Media-Partnership/"}]},{"title":"Capitol Gains — Why Banning Congressional Stock Trading Became Washington's Hottest Fight","date":"2025-08-02T17:00:00.000Z","path":"/post/CapitalGainsBlog.html","text":"Capitol Gains: The High-Stakes War to Ban Congress from Stock TradingWhen a normally sleepy Senate committee in late July advanced a bill to prohibit lawmakers from trading individual stocks, the 8-7 vote should have been a yawner—86 % of Americans want the practice stopped. Instead, the session detonated a political blast radius stretching from Capitol Hill to Mar-a-Lago. Senator Josh Hawley broke with fellow Republicans, former President Donald Trump blasted him as “second-tier,” and what began as an ethics tweak morphed into a test of partisan loyalty. 1. Transparency Failed: Lessons from the STOCK ActThe 2012 STOCK Act banked on sunlight: lawmakers could keep trading, they just had to disclose deals within 45 days. Reality check: $200 fines became a cost of doing business. Ethics committees routinely waived penalties. 78 members missed disclosure deadlines in 2023 alone. COVID-era briefings turned the failure into farce—senators privately dumped millions while publicly calming markets, and no one was charged. Transparency didn’t rebuild trust; it weaponized outrage. 2. Two Rival Fixes, One Philosophical Split Feature HONEST Act (Hawley &#x2F; Peters) Ban Congressional Stock Trading Act (Kelly &#x2F; Ossoff) Covered Members, spouses, President &amp; VP Members, spouses, kids Compliance Full divestment; blind trusts banned Divest or qualified blind trust Penalty 1 month salary or 10 % of asset value TBD (softer) Philosophy “Only a total ban restores trust.” “A truly blind trust works.” Blind-trust skeptics argue trustees can wink and nudge; advocates say forcing liquidation punishes honest wealth-holders. The fight isn’t over mechanics—it’s over whether Congress can ever “manage” temptation or must kill it outright. 3. Arguments in the ArenaPro-Ban Near-universal voter support (≈ 87 %). Even appearance of insider trading shreds legitimacy and compliance with laws. Simple: serve constituents, not your portfolio. Anti-Ban Could deter wealthy outsiders from running for office. Existing laws already cover insider trading (they say). Cato Institute warns markets lose valuable information if insiders can’t trade. The public frames it as fairness; many lawmakers frame it as financial inconvenience. That gap explains why overwhelming popularity hasn’t meant swift passage. 4. Beyond Stocks: Closing the Revolving DoorReformers link the trading ban to a broader crackdown on Washington’s money loops—like lifetime bans on former members lobbying Congress. The message: unplug every outlet where public office feeds private enrichment. 5. Will It Pass?Trump’s public whipping of Hawley spooked GOP leadership; without a floor vote, the HONEST Act likely dies unless stapled to a “must-pass” bill. Still, the sheer breadth of voter anger means some version is inevitable. The only question is when and how strong. Final TakeCongress tried “trust us” transparency and got a decade of scandals. Now voters want a bright-line ban, and senators must decide whether to serve Wall Street, K Street, or Main Street. Whatever compromise emerges, one truth is clear: public patience with self-policing is out of stock.","slug":"CapitalGainsBlog","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.987Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/CapitalGainsBlog.html","categories":[{"name":"politics","slug":"politics","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/politics/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Politics","slug":"Politics","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Politics/"},{"name":"Ethics","slug":"Ethics","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Ethics/"},{"name":"Finance","slug":"Finance","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Finance/"},{"name":"Congress","slug":"Congress","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Congress/"},{"name":"Stock Trading Ban","slug":"Stock-Trading-Ban","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Stock-Trading-Ban/"}]},{"title":"AI Unplugged: From Count-Based Exploration to a Jam Session with Vox","date":"2025-06-29T05:00:00.000Z","path":"/post/2025-06-29-ai-unplugged-from-count-based-exploration-to-a-jam-session-with-vox.html","text":"The Harmonious Convergence of AI and Human IngenuityIntroductionIn a world where artificial intelligence seems to evolve faster than a teenager’s music taste, three groundbreaking stories have emerged, harmonizing exploration, collaboration, and innovation.

The Great Aerial Mystery","date":"2024-12-29T06:00:00.000Z","path":"/post/DronesandDisbelief.html","text":"Of Drones and Disbelief: A Whirlwind Tour Through the Great Aerial MysteryIntroductionLet’s be honest: when we think about mysterious aerial sightings, most of us flash back to old-timey “flying saucer” videos or that grainy Bigfoot-with-a-jetpack footage your uncle insists he once saw on cable TV. But in today’s world, the strange objects swarming our skies aren’t green Martians or advanced alien toothbrushes—they’re drones. Cheap, efficient, and increasingly more common, drones have been buzzing around rooftops, backyards, national parks, and airports like the talkative cousins at a family barbecue. Yet, despite their obvious mechanical nature, there’s an almost laughably large segment of people, government agencies included, acting as though they’ve never seen a quadcopter before. The media and social media chatter has exploded with a mixture of alarm, confusion, and a healthy dose of eye-rolling skepticism. Are these “unidentified aerial phenomena” simply consumer gadgets run amok, or is there something more nefarious in play? Let’s dive headfirst into the swirling chaos and try not to get our hair singed by the propellers. The Public Frenzy: Everyone’s a Drone DetectiveIt all started when a rash of late-night sightings popped up on social media feeds. People recorded strange lights zig-zagging in the night sky, their grainy cell-phone videos accompanied by frantic commentary: “Dude, what IS that?” or “OMG, are we being invaded by tiny robo-bees?!” Twitter threads multiplied like overly enthusiastic rabbits, with each amateur detective offering a grand theory: government surveillance, alien reconnaissance, maybe even that old guy down the street testing his souped-up leaf blower with wings. Scroll through TikTok or Instagram, and you’ll find countless clips of luminous dots bobbing over suburban cul-de-sacs, each edit more dramatic than the last. The general consensus online? Nobody knows what’s going on, but everyone’s got a hot take—and if you don’t, you’re missing out on the biggest guessing game since we tried to figure out if that dress was blue or gold. In reality, drones are often just drones—commercial quadcopters, hobbyist rigs, or maybe even environmental survey devices. But confusion reigns supreme. Rumors swirl that international spy agencies have unleashed a fleet of stealth drones to monitor our microwave burrito consumption habits. Others swear up and down that these are secret government experiments so hush-hush they make the Men in Black look like a public relations team. And of course, there’s that persistent theory that aliens, presumably bored with crop circles, have embraced drone technology to keep an eye on our Wi-Fi passwords. The Media Circus: From Serious Journalism to Stand-Up ComedyTurn on the nightly news, and you’re treated to wide-eyed anchors carefully enunciating terms like “unidentified aerial phenomena” (as if they’re reading the menu at a fancy French restaurant). News segments splice together shaky cellphone videos, interviews with concerned citizens—some suspiciously wearing tinfoil hats—and soundbites from local authorities who claim, in their best official tone, that they’re “investigating all reports.” The whole performance often resembles an open-mic night at the local comedy club. Except instead of punchlines, we’re served ambiguous “no comments” and dramatic background music suggesting we’re one gust of wind away from a global conspiracy. One minute, you might have a decorated pilot insisting these sightings are definitely not weather balloons (has a weather balloon ever been responsible for anything other than confusion?), and the next, a local sheriff shrugs his shoulders and tosses out a noncommittal “We’re looking into it.” Meanwhile, the studio panelists argue over whether this is an issue of public safety, privacy violations, or a case of mass drone-hysteria. When it’s over, you’re left feeling like you just binged a docu-series about, well, absolutely nothing. But hey, at least it’s entertaining. Government Tight-Lippedness: The World’s Worst Poker FacePerhaps the most intriguing—and by intriguing, I mean utterly baffling—aspect of this fiasco is the government’s stance. Various agencies are doing a performance so over-the-top neutral, they should win an Olympic gold medal in Non-Commitment. You’d think with something as technologically basic as drones, the authorities would have a handle on it. After all, these are the same folks who keep satellites in orbit and launch space telescopes that can spot a dust mite on Mars. Yet, when it comes to these buzzing whirlybirds, they act like someone asked them to explain quantum physics after a double espresso: lots of blinking, stammering, and vague reassurances that they’ve got “no definitive information at this time.” On social media, frustrated citizens call out these evasive tactics, demanding transparency. The official response is usually an “uh, we’re working on it” followed by a polite cough and maybe a reference to “ongoing investigations.” Some speculate that the government knows exactly what’s going on but can’t say for fear of sparking panic. Others think the authorities are genuinely stumped. Then there’s the camp that believes the government is orchestrating these sightings to distract us from something else—like higher taxes on guacamole, or the fact that “Daylight Savings Time” is still a thing. A High-Flying Future: Drones, Regulations, and Our Collective SanitySo, what’s next? Drones aren’t going away. In fact, they’re likely to become more prevalent as technology advances. Soon enough, you might receive your pizza delivery from a friendly airborne courier doing barrel rolls over your driveway. It’s safe to assume that regulations will tighten, drone identification systems will improve, and we’ll reach a point where your local weatherman can tell you, “Today’s forecast: slight breeze, light rain, and the Johnsons’ Amazon drone delivering a set of highly questionable garden gnomes.” The current chaos, fueled by vague government responses and a cacophony of social media speculation, is likely just a stepping stone toward a more drone-literate society. As we grow accustomed to seeing these mechanical mosquitoes flit about, the excitement will wear off, and the sky will return to being just another dimension of our daily lives—albeit one peppered with tiny, buzzing paparazzi. ConclusionWe might be laughing now—and we should, because it’s kind of hilarious—but the confusion over drone sightings highlights a deeper issue: the widening gap between rapidly evolving technology and our ability, both public and governmental, to adapt and make sense of it. For now, let’s embrace the absurdity. Keep recording those videos, keep asking questions, and keep calling out the blank stares and “no comments” when they come. In the not-too-distant future, we’ll look back on this uproar and chuckle at the time we collectively freaked out about a fleet of glorified remote-control helicopters. Until then, keep your eyes on the skies (but maybe wear a hat—it could save you from a drone’s unexpected low-altitude cameo).","slug":"DronesandDisbelief","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.987Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/DronesandDisbelief.html","categories":[{"name":"Technology, Current Events","slug":"Technology-Current-Events","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Technology-Current-Events/"}],"tags":[{"name":"drones, sightings, government, conspiracy, social-media","slug":"drones-sightings-government-conspiracy-social-media","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/drones-sightings-government-conspiracy-social-media/"}]},{"title":"OpenAI’s New Pro Tier - A Disappointment at Ten Times the Price","date":"2024-12-18T18:31:52.000Z","path":"/post/open-ai-unhappy.html","text":"OpenAI’s New Pro Tier: A Disappointment at Ten Times the PriceIf youre like me—an AI enthusiast eager to explore the latest innovations—you probably watched OpenAI’s recent announcements with excitement. Their new Pro tier promised exclusive features for developers and tech aficionados, but after subscribing for $200&#x2F;month, I’m left feeling massively let down. Heres why. Sticker Shock: $200&#x2F;MonthThe jump from $20&#x2F;month to $200&#x2F;month is staggering. For a tenfold price hike, you’d expect revolutionary features or at least clear value propositions. Instead, the benefits feel marginal, leaving users like me scratching our heads. No API Access for o1-ProThe Pro tier touted the advanced o1-pro model, but there’s a catch: it’s not ready for API integration. Developers are paying a premium for a feature they can’t even use yet. This feels like a rushed launch without the polish we expect from OpenAI. The Sora DebacleSora, OpenAI’s new platform, launched with fanfare but quickly hit a wall. Just hours after going live, sign-ups were halted due to overwhelming demand. As a Pro member paying $200&#x2F;month, I assumed I’d get priority access—but I’m still locked out. What’s the point of paying for the highest tier if it doesn’t come with real perks? A Rushed RolloutThis entire launch feels poorly planned. Between the lack of API access, the Sora fiasco, and vague communication, OpenAI seems unprepared for the surge in user interest. For a company of their stature, this is surprising and frustrating. Community FrustrationI’m not alone in my disappointment. Across forums and social media, users are voicing similar concerns. The sentiment is clear: OpenAI needs to justify the Pro tier’s steep price by delivering tangible benefits, not just promises of future updates. What OpenAI Needs to Fix Clear Value Proposition: Show us exactly what $200&#x2F;month gets us, with detailed feature breakdowns. Priority Access: Pro members should receive exclusive or early access to new tools like Sora. Developer-Ready Tools: API integration for models like o1-pro should be available at launch. Transparent Communication: OpenAI must be upfront about delays and fixes, with clear timelines. Final Thoughts OpenAI has revolutionized the AI space, but this Pro tier launch risks alienating their most loyal users. At $200&#x2F;month, we expect more—more features, more access, and more transparency. Until OpenAI addresses these issues, I can’t recommend the Pro plan to others. What’s your take? Are you as frustrated as I am, or do you see value in the new Pro tier?

The conversations are no longer confined to the realms of science fiction but are becoming increasingly intertwined with the fabric of our reality. As we delve into the intricacies of this unfolding situation, we must acknowledge the serious undertones of what could become a pivotal moment in human history. The notion of an alien hoaxThe notion of an alien hoax has entered the mainstream, with claims that a calculated effort is underway to fabricate an extraterrestrial threat. The implications of such an orchestration are staggering. If we reflect on the past, events like 9&#x2F;11 and the Iraq War serve as reminders of how misinformation and manipulation can lead to profound consequences. The fear of an impending interplanetary conflict looms large, and if the warnings are to be believed, we might be facing a crisis that dwarfs previous global conflicts in its scope and severity. At the heart of this narrative lies a group of individuals, often referred to as the “Nut Job League,” whose influence appears to extend into reputable media outlets. This group has reportedly been disseminating information that casts an ominous shadow over the skies, suggesting that a threat to our national security is imminent. The rhetoric is charged with urgency, warning that we must brace ourselves for an invasion that could disrupt the very foundations of our society. Analyze the data… a notable increaseAs we analyze the data, a notable increase in UFO sightings has been reported across the globe, from the bustling streets of New York to the remote regions of Kazakhstan. This surge in sightings raises essential questions about the nature of these phenomena and the motivations behind their sudden visibility. Are we witnessing a genuine uptick in extraterrestrial activity, or is it a carefully orchestrated campaign to condition the public for something far more sinister? The term “autumn of the drones” has been coined to capture the essence of this unusual phenomenon, suggesting that we are entering a crucial period where military installations are increasingly under scrutiny due to drone activity. The significance of these sightings cannot be overstated; they represent a potential shift in the way we perceive our security and the very essence of our sovereignty. If these drones are more than mere technological advancements, we must consider the ramifications of their presence in sensitive areas. The year 2024 may well be viewed as a….But what does this all mean for the future? The year 2024 may well be viewed as a critical juncture in our collective understanding of extraterrestrial life and its implications. The fear of an alien invasion is not merely a plotline for Hollywood; it is becoming an increasingly relevant concern that requires our attention. We must approach the topic with seriousness, acknowledging the potential consequences of a society that is manipulated through fear and misinformation. As we navigate these turbulent waters, it is crucial to remain vigilant and discerning. We must question the motives behind the narratives we consume and consider the broader implications of a world that may be on the brink of a significant transformation. The idea of an intergalactic conflict is daunting, and the potential for manipulation raises alarms about the integrity of the information we receive. ConclusionIn conclusion, the convergence of UFO sightings, the potential for an alien hoax, and the looming specter of misinformation presents a complex landscape that demands our attention. It is imperative that we engage with these topics seriously, fostering open discussions that encourage critical thinking and informed decision-making. As we look to the future, we must remain aware of the forces that seek to shape our perceptions and prepare ourselves for a reality that may be unlike anything we have ever known. The gathering storm is upon us, and how we respond may determine the trajectory of our society in the years to come.","slug":"gatheringstorm","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.990Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/gatheringstorm.html","categories":[{"name":"Technology","slug":"Technology","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Technology/"},{"name":"Conspiracy","slug":"Technology/Conspiracy","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Technology/Conspiracy/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Conspiracy","slug":"Conspiracy","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Conspiracy/"},{"name":"Human Augmentation","slug":"Human-Augmentation","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Human-Augmentation/"},{"name":"UFO","slug":"UFO","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/UFO/"},{"name":"UAP","slug":"UAP","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/UAP/"},{"name":"government","slug":"government","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/government/"}]},{"title":"The AI Olympics: Will Enhanced Digital Coaches Engineer the Next Generation of Superhuman Records?","date":"2024-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","path":"/post/ai_olympics.html","text":"The AI Olympics: A Peek Into the Future of Beyond-Human AthleticsIntroductionPicture a future where human athletes don’t just train with the help of a humble stopwatch and an overcaffeinated coach yelling from the sidelines. Instead, they are guided by cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs that predict everything from optimal sleep schedules to the exact moment a sprinter should inhale before a final dash. These digital coaches would be so advanced they’d make your Fitbit look like a quaint 19th-century pocket watch. But let’s not just marvel at the shiny tech—some believe these “Enhanced AI Coaches” might be products of secret societies, forging a new breed of superhuman athletes who push beyond the current limits of flesh and bone. Sounds bonkers? Let’s dive in. Sculpting the Cyborg Sprinter: How AI Coaches Are Redefining Athlete TrainingFor decades, coaches relied on intuition, personal experience, and perhaps a pinch of luck (and a lot of screaming) to get their athletes into prime shape. Fast forward to our techno-utopia, and digital trainers are crunching terabytes of data per second. They analyze an athlete’s biomechanics, diet, muscle fiber composition, emotional states, and even how many spicy tacos they can handle before training. The result? Personalized training plans that make today’s one-size-fits-all routines look like lazy scribbles on a napkin. But what happens when AI coaches start updating strategies on the fly, adapting game plans mid-race, and anticipating an opponent’s next move before they’ve laced up their sneakers? Athletes guided by these super-intelligent systems might outpace records so consistently that current human achievements would seem quaint—like marveling at a VHS player in a 4K streaming world. Secret Sports Cabals: Are Elite Groups Engineering Future Records Behind the Scenes?Of course, this wouldn’t be a proper 21st-century scenario without a dash of conspiracy. Some whisper that clandestine networks—think Ivy League-educated illuminati or cryptic billionaires trading secrets over soy lattes—are pulling the strings behind these AI-driven coach programs. By quietly controlling which algorithms get deployed and which athletes get access to them, they could engineer star competitors who break records like toothpicks. Imagine a secret council deciding which sprinter’s neural implants get the next upgrade, or which swimmer’s AI coach unlocks a “hydrodynamic boost” mode. With enough influence, this hidden brain trust could sculpt an entirely new era of superhuman performers who run, jump, and swim far beyond the boundaries of what we call “natural.” Yes, it’s a wild thought, but so was the idea of streaming your cat videos from space once upon a time. The Great Debate: Technological Progress Versus Ethical BoundariesWhile we marvel at the future’s potential athletic prowess, we must also ponder the ethical landmines. Is it fair for someone to hold a secret key that transforms athletes into record-smashing cyborgs while everyone else is stuck with old-school squats and protein shakes? Are we crossing a moral line by letting algorithms dictate the shape of the human form? When do we stop and say, “Hold up, maybe this is getting too sci-fi for comfort”? Sports have always been about human struggle and triumph over our biological limits. Introducing AI masterminds and secret puppet masters might transform them into something entirely different—a contest of who can afford the better code, rather than who trained harder or dreamed bigger. The Dawn of the Hybrid Athlete: Where Do We Go From Here?If this trajectory continues, the stadiums of tomorrow might host hybrid athletes coached not by humans, but by data-driven entities that never sleep, never tire, and never forget a misstep. Records would tumble like dominoes, and we’d have to rethink what it means to be a champion. Is it the human who wins, or the algorithm behind them? Perhaps we’ll celebrate a new species of ultra-athletes who inspire humanity to redefine its potential. Or maybe we’ll find ourselves missing the charm of good old-fashioned coaches, red-faced and yelling encouragement in the rain. In any case, the AI Olympics beckon, and we can only hope our secret elites are kind enough to share their code. ConclusionAs we inch closer to a future shaped by AI-driven training, we stand at a crossroads. Will these digital coaches serve as unbiased aides to help humans achieve greatness, or will shadowy groups exploit their capabilities to create a new race of superhuman competitors? The next chapter in sports history might be less about blood, sweat, and tears, and more about bits, bytes, and backroom deals.

While “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” might seem like two ends of a summer blockbuster spectrum, a wild new theory suggests these cinematic juggernauts hit theaters just in time to derail public attention from something far more reality-warping: the gradual drip-drip of UFO disclosures by governments around the world. UAPs ExplosiveLet’s set the stage: In recent years, official chatter about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) has exploded. Government-backed task forces, leaked Navy footage, and even occasional Congressional statements have all but shoved a neon sign into our reality screaming, “Hey, Earthlings, we’ve seen stuff we can’t explain.” Usually, such revelations would send folks into fits of Reddit-fueled speculation, media frenzies, and, quite possibly, mass purchases of tinfoil hats. Instead, what do we get? We get “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” launching in tandem, with the press dubbing the colossal cinematic moment “Barbenheimer.” Millions flooded theaters, becoming cheerleaders for 2023’s most meme-worthy phenomenon. Meanwhile, UFO buzz? Quietly lost in the cosmic ether. UAPs in Pop CultureIf we slide down the conspiracy rabbit hole a bit, it’s almost too convenient. Think about it: just as the U.S. government decides to release slightly more candid tidbits about UAP sightings—enough to make you raise an eyebrow—the pop culture machine cranks up a distraction that’s practically impossible to ignore. After all, who wants to sift through declassified documents when you can debate whether Ryan Gosling’s Ken sold more tickets than Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer? Hollywood’s secret sauce—mega stars, candy-colored marketing campaigns, and explosive nuclear visuals—may be deliciously timed seasoning on a plate we didn’t realize we were being served. UAPs in MediaOf course, we’re not here to say you can’t enjoy your cinematic escapism. Far from it! The point is to understand how mass media’s grand spectacles can overshadow other, more unsettling truths. UFO disclosures are no longer just for late-night talk radio. They’re sprinkled throughout serious government briefings and credible journalistic investigations. If the powers-that-be wanted to minimize how loudly we screamed “Aliens!” into the void, what better way than handing us existential doll dramas and moral quandaries drenched in box-office hype? UAPs in RelevanceLet’s not forget that even if Hollywood didn’t conspire to overshadow UFO revelations, the sheer weight of pop-culture excitement naturally drowns out smaller stories. Popcorn flicks—like well-aimed confetti cannons—can blind us to what’s lurking on the periphery. The timing of “Barbenheimer” could just be a cosmic coincidence, yet the questions raised remind us: staying informed is an active choice. We should savor the cinema and enjoy every “Kenergy” moment, but also pay attention to revelations that could redefine our understanding of reality. Who knows, maybe the truth is out there… buried under a mountain of movie posters. UAPs in firmSo, the next time you find yourself debating whether Barbie’s high heels are more iconic than Oppenheimer’s chain-smoking intensity, consider this: are you blissfully sipping your soda while humanity’s biggest mystery remains an afterthought? It’s fun to don your neon outfit and hit the theater, but it’s also worth peeking outside the cinema’s exit door to see if our cosmic neighbors have finally decided to knock.","slug":"benheimersHidden","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.988Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/benheimersHidden.html","categories":[{"name":"Entertainment","slug":"Entertainment","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Entertainment/"},{"name":"Conspiracy","slug":"Entertainment/Conspiracy","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Entertainment/Conspiracy/"},{"name":"UFOs","slug":"Entertainment/Conspiracy/UFOs","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Entertainment/Conspiracy/UFOs/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hollywood","slug":"Hollywood","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Hollywood/"},{"name":"UFO","slug":"UFO","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/UFO/"},{"name":"Disclosure","slug":"Disclosure","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Disclosure/"},{"name":"Barbenheimer","slug":"Barbenheimer","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/Barbenheimer/"}]},{"title":"Apple Releases iOS AI Model - A Game-Changer in Natural Language Processing","date":"2024-04-26T03:31:52.000Z","path":"/post/Apple-AI-mobilemodel.html","text":"Apple Releases iOS AI Model: A Game-Changer in Natural Language ProcessingIn a groundbreaking move that promises to reshape the landscape of natural language processing, Apple has unveiled OpenELM (Open-source Efficient Language Models), a suite of eight open-source large language models (LLMs) optimized for on-device use.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has recently sent out a nationwide memo to secretaries of state, warning of “extremely alarming” threats. It seems our next election might have more suspense than the season finale of your favorite series. Since the nail-biting 2020 presidential showdown between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, election security has catapulted from a subplot to the main storyline. The saga, with its cliffhanger that took days to resolve in Biden’s favor, spawned a series of lawsuits faster than you can say “recount.” Some conservatives, led by Trump, didn’t just cry over spilled ballots—they claimed the whole milk carton was rotten, leading to the infamous Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. Now, in a plot twist no one saw coming (or did we?), Trump is waiting in the wings, facing a criminal trial after being indicted on four counts for allegedly attempting to script his own ending to the 2020 election saga. The charges read like the back of a blockbuster movie cover: conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government and obstruct an official proceeding. But wait, there’s more! Last August, Trump and his ensemble cast of 18 others were indicted by a Georgia grand jury for their alleged roles in trying to overturn the state’s 2020 results. The Republican front-runner for the 2024 nomination, in a move that shocked absolutely no one, pleaded not guilty to all charges. According to Timothy Langan, the FBI’s equivalent of a leading man in the Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch, “The threat environment, unfortunately, is very high.” He delivered this line at the winter conference of the National Association of Secretaries of State in Washington, making everyone wish they had popped some popcorn before the meeting started. As we brace ourselves for the next episode in this ongoing political thriller, one thing is clear: the path to the 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be anything but boring. With the stakes higher than ever, our nation’s secretaries of state are on the front lines, armed with nothing but their wits and an unwavering commitment to democracy. So, grab your favorite snack and settle in. This is one show you won’t want to miss. And remember, unlike TV dramas, the outcome of this story affects us all. Let’s make sure we play our part by staying informed, engaged, and ready to vote. Because in the end, the future of our democracy is not just in the hands of those who lead us but in the actions of every voter. Newsweek attempted to reach out to the FBI for a sneak peek into the next season, but at the time of writing, our emails remain as unanswered as the questions surrounding the next election. Stay tuned, folks. The drama is just getting started.","slug":"more_conspiracys","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.991Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/more_conspiracys.html","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Enhagned Games - From Steroids to Stardom - the New Era of Superhuman Sports Spectacles","date":"2024-02-02T15:30:55.000Z","path":"/post/enhanced_sports.html","text":"The Enhanced Games: Redefining Athletic ExcellenceThe Enhanced Games is a pioneering initiative set to revolutionize the sports world by fully embracing the integration of scientific advancements with human athletic performance.

Today, we unravel the theory that “Snowpiercer” is not just a stand-alone post-apocalyptic tale, but a sequel to the whimsical “Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory.” Sounds like a fantasy, but could there be a golden ticket of truth here? The Wonka-Wilford TransformationImagine young Charlie Bucket, the heart of “Willy Wonka,” evolving into Wilford, the enigmatic creator of the Snowpiercer. It’s a transformation from a candy-filled dream to a frost-bitten reality. The theory, proposed by Rhino Stew, suggests that after inheriting Wonka’s empire, Charlie (now Wilford) used his newfound knowledge and resources to respond to a global crisis, thus creating the Snowpiercer. Connecting Characters Gilliam &#x3D; Mr. Wilkinson&#x2F;Slugworth: This theory plays on the idea of deception and loyalty. In “Willy Wonka,” Slugworth is a façade, a test of character for the golden ticket winners. Similarly, Gilliam in “Snowpiercer” is a spy and a pivotal character in maintaining order and balance on the train, mirroring Slugworth’s role in Wonka’s world. Minister Mason &#x3D; Veruca Salt: Post-garbage chute trauma, Veruca Salt transforms into Minister Mason. The theory suggests that her near-death experience left her deeply indebted and loyal to Wilford&#x2F;Charlie, thus explaining her authoritative, slightly unhinged demeanor in “Snowpiercer.” The Oompa Loompa EnigmaA crucial element of Willy Wonka’s factory, the Oompa Loompas, are absent in “Snowpiercer.” The theory suggests their extinction, leading to Wilford’s use of children for maintenance tasks in the train. It’s a dark twist, reflecting the harsh realities of survival in the new world. Themes and ParallelsBoth films explore class struggles, destiny, and sacrifice. The journey through the fantastical structures in both movies - the chocolate factory and the train - serves as a metaphor for societal structures and the trials one must overcome. The endgame in both? Finding a worthy successor to carry on a legacy. ConclusionWhile this theory is a banquet of imaginative connections, it’s essential to take it with a pinch of salt (or a dash of cocoa). The parallels are intriguing, and the character transformations are fascinating to ponder, but at its core, this theory is a testament to the power of storytelling and the endless possibilities it holds.","slug":"conspiracy_snowpiercer","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.989Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/conspiracy_snowpiercer.html","categories":[{"name":"articles","slug":"articles","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/articles/"}],"tags":[{"name":"conspiracy","slug":"conspiracy","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/conspiracy/"}]},{"title":"Area 51 A Nexus of Alien Conspiracy Theories","date":"2024-01-29T07:58:55.000Z","path":"/post/area_51.html","text":"Area 51: A Nexus of Alien Conspiracy TheoriesIntroductionArea 51, the enigmatic military base in Nevada, has been a magnet for conspiracy theories for decades. Despite being visible on satellite images, it’s a place shrouded in secrecy, adding to its allure. The Root of the TheoriesTheories range from alien experiments to staged moon landings. The site was historically so secretive that it was absent from public U.S. government maps. Historical Background Project Oxcart: In the 1950s and 1960s, Area 51 was home to this top-secret Cold War-era program. Its aim was to develop spy planes like the A-12, capable of traveling over 2,000 miles per hour. Aerial Gunner Training: During World War II, the site was used as an aerial gunnery range. U-2 and A-12 Development: Selected by the CIA for testing high altitude reconnaissance aircraft, leading to innovations like the U-2 and the A-12. Public Speculation and UFO SightingsThe advanced aircraft tested at Area 51 often resembled UFOs, fueling public speculation and numerous UFO sightings. This, combined with the site’s secrecy, has perpetuated the alien conspiracy theories. The CIA’s AcknowledgmentIn 2013, the CIA released declassified documents acknowledging Area 51’s existence and detailing the U-2 and Oxcart programs. This was a significant moment in the base’s history, but it didn’t fully quell the public’s fascination with extraterrestrial theories. ConclusionWhile Area 51’s history is rich with advanced aerial testing and development, the combination of secrecy and human curiosity has allowed alien experiment conspiracy theories to flourish, creating a narrative that continues to captivate imaginations worldwide.

Reports say he’s building a $100 million compound with a massive underground bunker. Why? Well, let’s dive in like we’re infiltrating a secret Facebook group. 1. The “Why” Behind Zuck’s Hawaiian FortressFirst off, why Hawaii? Because when you’re worth billions, why not? Hawaii is like the group chat everyone wants to be in – exclusive and picturesque. But why a compound? Maybe Zuck’s taking FarmVille to a whole new level, or perhaps he’s just really into Lilo &amp; Stitch. Now, about that underground bunker. We can speculate a few reasons: Privacy, Please: It’s no secret that Zuck values privacy (for himself, at least). The Superhero Lair Theory: Maybe he’s crafting a superhero identity. Iron Man started in a cave, after all. Zombie Apocalypse Prep: Because why not? If you have billions, preparing for the undead is a weekend hobby. 2. The Elite’s Escapade: Are Others Doing the Same?Zuckerberg isn’t alone in his quest for luxurious isolation. It’s like a VIP club for the ultra-rich. Billionaire Bunkers: It’s a trend! Other elites are reportedly building fancy hideouts. Think of it as an upgrade from backyard treehouses. Escaping the Spotlight: Maybe they’re just tired of paparazzi and want a break from being absurdly wealthy in public. 3. What’s He Hiding? – Apart from His Browser HistoryIs Zuck hiding something? Besides his browser history, we can only guess: Alien Communication Center: Just kidding. Or are we? Time Machine Project: To go back and reinvent the ‘poke’ feature, perhaps. A Secret Lab: Where the only experiment is finding a way to wear something other than a gray T-shirt. 4. The Compound Itself: Cribs, Billionaire EditionLet’s talk about the compound. We’re expecting: Smart Everything: Lights, doors, and even the plants are probably Wi-Fi enabled. Eco-Friendly Features: Maybe a nod to sustainability, because even billionaires think green (in more ways than one). A Garage Full of Not-Your-Average Cars: Because when you have a compound, you can’t just park a Prius there. 5. The Local Impact: Not Everyone’s Clicking ‘Like’Not everyone in Hawaii is throwing shakas about this. There’s concern about: Land and Culture: Hawaii has a rich cultural history, and there’s a fine line between being a resident and an invader. The Neighborhood Vibe: Imagine telling your neighbors, “Yeah, Mark Zuckerberg lives next door and he’s built an underground lair.” 6. The Future of Billionaire BunkersWhat does this trend mean for the future? Rich Guy Race to Space: First underground, then Mars? Elon Musk might have competition. Luxury Apocalypse Prepping: It’s like regular prepping, but with champagne and caviar. 7. In Conclusion: The Zuck Bunker MysteryIn the end, Mark Zuckerberg’s $100M Hawaiian compound is a mix of mystery, intrigue, and a dash of Silicon Valley eccentricity. Whether it’s for privacy, security, or just a really extravagant way to play Minecraft in real life, one thing is certain: when you’re a billionaire, the world is your oyster, and apparently, Hawaii is your pearl. As we await more details, we’ll be here, refreshing our feeds and wondering what’s next in the billionaire bunker saga. Will it be a trendsetter or just another quirky billionaire move? Only time (and probably a few leaked documents) will tell.","slug":"zuck-hawaii-bunker","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.994Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/zuck-hawaii-bunker.html","categories":[{"name":"tech","slug":"tech","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/tech/"}],"tags":[{"name":"news","slug":"news","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/news/"}]},{"title":"Fanttik E1 Pro 3.7V Mini Electric Screwdriver - The Ultimate Tool for DIY Enthusiasts!","date":"2023-12-09T00:41:52.000Z","path":"/post/Fanttik-E1-Pro.html","text":"Fanttik E1 Pro 3.7V Mini Electric Screwdriver: The Ultimate Tool for DIY Enthusiasts!Do you ever find yourself fumbling with a manual screwdriver, wishing for a more efficient, powerful, and user-friendly option?

Let’s talk about something that’s been bugging me lately. You know those large language models, like ChatGPT? Yeah, those incredibly smart, sometimes eerily human-like chatbots. Well, guess what? Some brainy folks at Imperial College London just tossed a paper into the academic ring, published in Nature, no less, suggesting we might need to tweak how we jabber with these digital geniuses. 🧠 Chatting with a Bot: It’s Not Just Small Talk Anymore!These chatbots, powered by neural network-based large language models (LLMs), can make you feel like you’re texting your bestie instead of a bunch of code. It’s like they’ve taken a crash course in human charm! But here’s the kicker: our brains, those squishy, sociable organs, get tricked into thinking we’re having a heart-to-heart with another human. Why This Could Be a Problem (Hint: It’s Not Just Awkward Conversations)Imagine this: you’re chatting away, and suddenly, you’re sharing your deepest secrets or, worse, your bank details (because who wouldn’t trust a friendly chatbot, right?). Enter the potential for scammers and propagandists. They could use these LLMs to play on our inherent need for connection, leading us down some not-so-rosy paths. The Grand Solution: Time to Rethink our Chatbot ChatterProfessor Murray Shanahan and his team suggest we stop making these LLMs sound like our long-lost siblings. You know, phrases like “ChatGPT totally gets me,” or “It’s like it’s reading my mind!” Nope. According to these brainiacs, this anthropomorphizing (fancy word for making things human-like) makes our social brains go overboard. The Game Plan: Metaphors and More MetaphorsThe team proposes two metaphors. First up, think of AI chatbots as actors in a one-character play. They’re just playing a part, folks! Next, for those who like a twist, view them as cosmic gamblers, betting on roles in a multiverse of characters. Trippy, right? Professor Shanahan says, “Don’t get hung up on one metaphor. Dance between them!” (Okay, maybe he didn’t say ‘dance,’ but I like to imagine he did.) In Conclusion: Let’s Keep it Light!So, next time you’re typing away to your favorite chatbot, remember: it’s not your BFF, your therapist, or your dog. It’s a super-smart, role-playing, universe-jumping piece of code. And hey, that’s pretty cool in its own right! What do you think? Ready to change how you chat with chatbots?

It’s where Nikola Tesla, the Serbian-American inventor, worked on his groundbreaking experiments. Picture this: a laboratory brimming with buzzing electricity, the air crackling with potential, a true playground for one of history’s greatest minds. The Fire: An Unexpected Plot TwistTuesday night was not your typical evening at the Tesla Science Center. Over 100 firefighters from nearly a dozen fire departments responded to a dramatic scene. Flames engulfed a part of the center, threatening to turn a piece of history into ashes. The cause of the fire remains a mystery, adding a layer of intrigue to an already fascinating place. Was it an unfortunate accident or a historical echo of Tesla’s own fiery mishaps in his labs? The plot thickens! The Restoration Efforts: A Labor of LoveBefore the fire, the center was undergoing a loving restoration. The chimney and cupola, two architectural crowns of the building, were being returned to their former glory. The team from Thaler Reilly Wilson Architecture and Preservation, LLP, historical architecture experts, were leading this delicate operation. Imagine skilled artisans and architects, poring over old blueprints, meticulously working to preserve every brick and beam of Tesla’s last lab. The Aftermath and Investigation: Piecing Together the PuzzleMarc Alessi, the executive director, paints a picture of a project paused in anticipation. Construction was on the cusp of beginning. Now, a team of experts, including site engineers, historical architects, and structural engineers, along with the Suffolk County Police Department and the Brookhaven Town Fire Marshal, are like detectives in a historical mystery. They’ll sift through the clues, assessing the damage, and determining the fire’s cause. This is CSI: Tesla Edition. Tesla Science Center: More Than a MuseumThis non-profit organization is not just preserving a building; they’re keeping Tesla’s flame alive. They’re dedicated to educating the public about Tesla’s work and turning his last standing lab into a museum and global science center. Their annual gala, a testament to Tesla’s enduring legacy, is like the Met Gala for science enthusiasts, celebrating both Tesla’s past achievements and the center’s future. Nikola Tesla: The Man Behind the MythTesla’s story is like a script from a Hollywood blockbuster. A Serbian immigrant who came to America in 1884, worked with Thomas Edison, and went on to revolutionize the way we use electricity. His work laid the foundation for modern conveniences like wi-fi, radio, remote controls, and electric motors. Tesla was a visionary, a showman, and a genius, credited with over 300 patents. Yet, his life was not without drama. Many of his laboratories suffered fires, which, in a twist of fate, is a shadow that seems to have followed him to the present day. As we await further updates, the story of the fire at the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe is a reminder of the thin line between preservation and loss, between history and legend. It’s a narrative that continues to evolve, much like Tesla’s own legacy in the annals of science and invention.

This is going to be quite a Sherlock Holmes adventure and sleuth detective-exemplifying journey that I will be taking you on. Please put on your thinking cap and get yourself a soothing glass of wine. The roots of the circumstance involve the recent organizational gyrations and notable business crisis drama associated with the AI maker OpenAI, including the off and on-again firing and then rehiring of the CEO Sam Altman, along with a plethora of related carry-ons. My focus will not particularly be the comings and goings of the parties involved. I instead seek to leverage those reported facts primarily as telltale clues associated with the AI-mystery that some believe sits at the core of the organizational earthquake. We shall start with the vaunted goal of arriving at the topmost AI. The Background Of The AI Mystery So, here’s the deal.Some suggest that OpenAI has landed upon a new approach to AI that either has attained true AI, which is nowadays said to be Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or that demonstrably resides on or at least shows the path toward AGI. As a fast backgrounder for you, today’s AI is considered not yet at the realm of being on par with human intelligence. The aspirational goal for much of the AI field is to arrive at something that fully exhibits human intelligence, which would broadly then be considered as AGI, or possibly going even further into superintelligence (for my analysis on what this AI “superhuman” aspects might consist of, see the link here). Nobody has yet been able to find out and report specifically on what this mysterious AI breakthrough consists of (if indeed such an AI breakthrough was at all devised or invented). This situation could be like one of those circumstances where the actual occurrence is a far cry from the rumors that have reverberated in the media. Maybe the reality is that something of modest AI advancement was discovered but doesn’t deserve the hoopla that has ensued. Right now, the rumor mill is filled with tall tales that this is the real deal and supposedly will open the door to reaching AGI. Time will tell.On the matter of whether the AI has already achieved AGI per se, let’s noodle on that postulation. It seems hard to imagine that if the AI became true AGI we wouldn’t already be regaled with what it is and what it can do. That would be a chronicle of immense magnitude. Could the AI developers involved be capable of keeping a lid on such a life goal attainment that they miraculously found the source of the Nile or that they essentially turned stone into gold? Seems hard to believe that the number of people likely knowing this fantastical outcome would be utterly secretive and mum for any considerable length of time. The seemingly more plausible notion is that they arrived at a kind of AI that shows promise toward someday arriving at AGI. You could likely keep that a private secret for a while. The grand question though looming over this would be the claimed basis for asserting that the AI is in fact on the path to AGI. Such a basis should conceivably be rooted in substantive ironclad logic, one so hopes. On the other hand, perhaps the believed assertion of being on the path to AGI is nothing more than a techie hunch. Those kinds of hunches are at times hit-and-miss.You see, this is the way that those ad hoc hunches frequently go. You think you’ve landed on the right trail, but you are actually once again back in the woods. Or you are on the correct trail, but the top of the mountain is still miles upon miles in the distance. Simply saying or believing that you are on the path to AGI is not necessarily the same as being on said path. Even if you are on the AGI path, perhaps the advancement is a mere inch whilst the distance ahead is still far away. One can certainly rejoice in advancing an inch, don’t get me wrong on that. The issue is how much the inch is parlayed into being portrayed intentionally or inadvertently as getting us to the immediate doorstep of AGI. The Clues That Have Been Hinted AtNow that you know the overarching context of the AI mystery, we are ready to dive into the hints or clues that so far have been reported on the matter. We will closely explore those clues. This will require some savvy Sherlock Holmes AI-considered insights. A few caveats are worth mentioning at the get-go. A shrewd detective realizes that some clues are potentially solid inklings, while some clues are wishy-washy or outright misleading. When you are in the fog of war about solving a mystery there is always a chance that you are bereft of sufficient clues. Later on, once the mystery is completely solved and revealed, only then can you look back and discern which clues were on target and which ones were of little use. Alluringly, clues can also be a distraction and take you in a direction that doesn’t solve the mystery. And so on. Given those complications, let’s go ahead and endeavor to do the best we can with the clues at this time that seem to be available (more clues are undoubtedly going to leak out in the next few days and weeks; I’ll provide further coverage in my column postings as that unfolds). I am going to draw upon these relatively unsubstantiated foremost three clues:a) The name of the AI has been said to be supposedly Q*.b) The AI has supposedly been able to solve grade-school-level math problems quite well.c) The AI has possibly leveraged an AI technique known as test-time computations (TTC).You can find lots of rampant speculation online that uses only the first of those above clues, namely the name of Q*. Some believe that the mystery can be unraveled on that one clue alone. They might not know about the other two above clues. Or they might not believe that the other two clues are pertinent. I am going to choose to use all three clues and piece them together in a kind of mosaic that may provide a different perspective than others have espoused online about the mystery. Just wanted to let you know that my detective work might differ somewhat from other narratives you might read about elsewhere online. The First Clue Is The Alleged Name Of The AI It has been reported widely that the AI maker has allegedly opted to name the AI software as being referred to by the notation of a capital letter Q that is followed by an asterisk. The name or notation is this: Q*.Believe it or not, by this claimed name alone, you can go into a far-reaching abyss of speculation about what the AI is. I suppose it is somewhat akin to the word “Rosebud” in the famous classic film Citizen Kane. I won’t spoil the movie other than to emphasize that the entire film is about trying to make sense of the seemingly innocuous word of Rosebud. If you have time to do so, I highly recommend watching the movie since it is considered one of the best films of all time. There isn’t any AI in it, so realize you would be watching the movie for its incredible plot, splendid acting, eye-popping cinematography, etc., and relishing the deep mystery ardently pursued throughout the movie. Back to our mystery in hand.What can we divine from the Q* name?Those of you who are faintly familiar with everyday mathematical formulations are likely to realize that the asterisk is typically said to represent a so-called star symbol. Thus, the seemingly “Q-asterisk” name would conventionally be pronounced aloud as “Q-star” rather than as Q-asterisk. There is nothing especially out of the ordinary in mathematical notations to opt to make use of the asterisk as a star notation. It is done quite frequently, and I will shortly explain why this is the case. Overall, the use specifically of the letter Q innately coupled with the star representation does not notably denote anything already popularized in the AI field. Ergo, I am saying that Q* doesn’t jump out as meaning this particular AI technique or that particular AI technology. It is simply the letter Q that is followed by an asterisk (which we naturally assume by convention represents a star symbol). Aha, our thinking caps now come into play. We will separate the letter Q from its accompanying asterisk. Doing so is seemingly productive. Here’s why. The capital letter Q does have significance in the AI field. Furthermore, the use of an asterisk as a star symbol does have significance in the mathematics and computer science arena. By looking at the significance of each distinctly, we can subsequently make a reasonable leap of logic as a result of considering the meaning associated when they are combined in unification. I will start by unpacking the use of the asterisk.What The Asterisk Or Star Symbol Signifies One of the most historically well-known uses of the asterisk in a potentially similar context was the use by the mathematician Stephen Kleene when he defined something known as V*. You might cleverly observe that this notation consists of the capital letter V that is followed by the asterisk. It is pronounced as V-star. In his paper published in the 1950s, he described that suppose you had a set of items that were named by the capital letter V, and you then decided to make a different set that consisted of various combinations associated with the items that are in the set V. This new set will by definition contain all the elements of set V and will show them furthermore in as many concatenated ways as we can come up with. The resulting new set will be denoted as V* (there are other arcane rules about this formulation, but I am only seeking to give a brief tasting herein). As an example about this matter, suppose that I had a set consisting of the first three lowercase letters of the alphabet: {“a”, ”b”, ”c”}. I will go ahead and refer to that set as the set V. We have a set V that consists of {“a”, ”b”, ”c”}. You are then to come up with V* by making lots of combinations of the elements in V. You are allowed to repeat the elements as much as you wish. Thus, the V* will contain elements like this: {“a”, ”b”, ”c”, ”ab”, “ac”, “ba”, “bc”, “aa”, “bb”, “cc”, “aaa”, “aab”, “aac”, …}. I trust that you see that the V* is a combination of the elements of V. This V* is kind of amazing in that it has all kinds of nifty combinations. I am not going to get into the details of why this is useful and will merely bring your attention to the fact that the asterisk or star symbol suggests that whatever set V you have there is another set V* that is much richer and fuller. I would recommend that those of you keenly interested in mathematics and computer science might want to see a classic noteworthy article by Stephen Kleene entitled “Representation of Events in Nerve Nets and Finite Automata” which was published by Princeton University Press in 1956. You can also readily find lots of explanations online about V*. Your overall takeaway here is that when you use a capital letter and join it with an asterisk, the conventional implication in mathematics and computer science is that you are saying that the capital letter is essentially supersized. You are magnifying whatever the original thing is. To some degree, you are said to be maximizing it to the nth degree. Are you with me on this so far? I hope so. Let’s move on and keep this asterisk and star symbol stuff in mind. The Use Of Asterisk Or Star In The Case Of Capital A You are going to love this next bit of detective work. I’ve brought you up-to-speed about the asterisk and showed you an easy example involving the capital letter V. Well, in the AI field, there is a famous instance that involves the capital letter A. We have hit a potential jackpot regarding the underlying mystery being solved, some believe. Allow me to explain.The famous instance of the capital letter “A” which is accompanied by an asterisk in the field of AI is shown this way: A*. It is pronounced as A-star. As an aside, when I was a university professor, I always taught A* in my university classes on AI for undergraduates and graduates. Any budding computer science student learning about AI should be at least aware of the A* and what it portends. This is a foundational keystone for AI. In brief, a research paper in the 1960s proposed an AI foundational approach to a difficult mathematical problem such as trying to find the shortest path to get from one city to another city. If you are driving from Los Angeles to New York and you have let’s assume thirty cities that you might go through to get to your destination, which cities would you pick to minimize the time or distance for your planned trip? You certainly would want to use a mathematical algorithm that can aid in calculating the best or at least a really good path to take. This also relates to the use of computers. If you are going to use a computer to figure out the path, you want a mathematical algorithm that can be programmed to do so. You want that mathematical algorithm to be implementable on a computer and run as fast as possible or use the least amount of computing resources as you can. The classic paper that formulated A* is entitled “A Formal Basis for the Heuristic Determination of Minimum Cost Paths” by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson, and Bertram Raphael, published in IEEE Transactions on Systems Science and Cybernetics, 1968. The researchers said this: “Imagine a set of cities with roads connecting certain pairs of them. Suppose we desire a technique for discovering a sequence of cities on the shortest route from a specific start to a specified goal city. Our algorithm prescribes how to use special knowledge – e.g., the knowledge that the shortest route between any pair of cities cannot be less than the airline distance between them – in order to reduce the total number of cities that need to be considered.” The paper proceeds to define the algorithm that they named as A*. You can readily find online lots and lots of descriptions about how A* works. It is a step-by-step procedure or technique. Besides being useful for solving travel-related problems, the A* is used for all manner of search-related issues. For example, when playing chess, you can think of finding the next chess move as a search-related problem. You might use A* and code it into part of a chess-playing program. You might be wondering whether the A* has a counterpart possibly known as simply A. In other words, I mentioned earlier that we have V* which is a variant or supersizing of V. You’ll be happy to know that some believe that A* is somewhat based on an algorithm which is at times known as A. Do tell, you might be thinking.In the 1950s, the famous mathematician and computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra came up with an algorithm that is considered one of the first articulated techniques to figure out the shortest paths between various nodes in a weighted graph (once again, akin to the city traveling problem and more). Interestingly, he figured out the algorithm in 1956 while sitting in a café in Amsterdam and according to his telling of how things arose, the devised technique only took about twenty minutes for him to come up with. The technique became a core part of his lifelong legacy in the field of mathematics and computer science. He took his time to write it up. He published a paper about it three years later, and it is a highly readable and mesmerizing read, see E. W. Dijkstra, “A Note on Two Problems in Connection with Graphs”, published in Numerische Mathematik, 1959. Some have suggested that the later devised A* is essentially based on the A of his works. There is a historical debate about that. What can be said with relative sensibility is that the A* is a much more extensive and robust algorithm for doing similar kinds of searches. I’ll leave things there and not get mired in the historical disputes. I’d like to add two more quick comments about the use of the asterisk symbol in the computer field.First, those of you who happen to know coding or programming or the use of computer commands are perhaps aware that a longstanding use of the asterisk has been as a wildcard character. This is pretty common. Suppose I want to inform you that you are to identify all the words that can be derived based on the root word or letters “dog”. For example, you might come up with the word “doggie” or the word “dogmatic”. I could succinctly tell you what you can do by putting an asterisk at the end of the root word, like this: “dog*”. The asterisk is considered once again to be a star symbol and implies that you can put whatever letters you want after the first fixed set of three letters of “dog”. Secondly, another perspective on the asterisk when used with a capital letter is that it is the last or furthest possible iteration or version of something. Let’s explore this. Suppose I make a piece of software and I decide to refer to it via the capital letter B. My first version might be referred to as B1. My second version might be referred to as B2. On and on this goes. I might later on have B26, the twenty-sixth version, and much later maybe B8245 which is presumably the eight thousand two hundred forty-fifth version. A catchy or cutesy way to refer to the end of all of the versions might be to say B*. The asterisk or star symbol in this case tells us that whatever is named as “B*” is the highest or final of all of the versions that we could ever come up with.I will soon revisit these points and show you why they are part of the detective work. The Capital Letter Q Is Considered A Hefty Clue You are now aware of the asterisk or star symbol. Congratulations! We need to delve into the capital letter Q. The seemingly most likely reference to the capital letter Q that exists in the field of AI would indubitably be something known as Q-learning. Some have speculated that the Q might instead be a reference to the work of the famous mathematician Richard Bellman and his optimal value function in the Bellman equation. Sure, I get that. We don’t know if that’s the reference being made. I’m going to make a detective instinctive choice and steer toward the Q that is in Q-learning. I’m using my Ouija board to help out. Sometimes it is right, sometimes it is wrong. Q-learning is an important AI technique. Once again, it is a topic that I always covered in my AI classes and that I expected my students to know by heart. The technique makes use of reinforcement learning. You are already generally aware of “reinforcement learning” by your likely life experiences. Let’s make sure you are comfortable with the intimidatingly fancy phrase “reinforcement learning”. Suppose you are training a dog to perform a handshake or shall we say paw shake. You give the dog a verbal command such as telling the cute puppy to do a handshake. The dog lifts its tiny paw to touch your outreached hand. To reward this behavior, you give the dog a delicious canine treat. You continue doing this repeatedly. The dog is rewarded with a treat for each time that it performs the heartwarming trick. If the dog doesn’t do the trick when commanded, you don’t provide the treat. In a sense, the denial of a treat is almost a penalty too. You could have a more explicit penalty such as scowling at the dog, but usually, the more advisable course of action is to focus on rewards rather than also including explicit penalties. All in all, the dog is being taught by reinforcement learning. You are reinforcing the behavior you desire by providing rewards. The hope is that the dog is somehow within its adorable canine brain getting the idea that doing a handshake is a good thing. The internal mental rules that the dog is perhaps devising are that when the command to do a handshake is spoken, the best bet is to lift its handy paw since doing so is amply rewarded. Q-learning is an AI technique that seeks to leverage reinforcement learning in a computer or is said to be implemented computationally. The algorithm consists of mathematically and computationally examining a current state or step and trying to figure out which next state or step would be the best to undertake. Part of this consists of anticipating the potential future states or steps. The idea is to see if the rewards associated with those future states can be added up and provide the maximum attainable reward. You presumably do something like this in real life. Consider this. If I choose to go to college, I might get a better-paying job than if I don’t go to college. I might also be able to buy a better house than if I didn’t go to college. There are lots of possible rewards so I might add them all up to see how much that might be. That is one course or sequence of steps and maybe it is good for me or maybe there is something better. If I don’t go to college, I can start working in my chosen field of endeavor right away. I will have four years of additional work experience prior to those that went to college. It could be that those four years of experience will give me a long-lasting advantage over having used those years to go to college. I consider the down-the-road rewards associated with that path. Upon adding up the rewards for each of those two respective paths, I might decide that whichever path has the maximum calculated reward is the better one for me to pick. You might say that I am adding up the expected values. To make things more powerful, I might decide to weight the rewards. For example, I mentioned that I am considering how much money I will make. It could be that I also am considering the type of lifestyle and work that I will do. I could give greater weight to the type of lifestyle and work while giving a bit less weight to the money side of things. The formalized way to express all of this is that an agent, which in the example is me, will be undertaking a series of steps, which we will denote as states, and taking actions that transition the agent from one state to the next state. The goal of the agent entails maximizing a total reward. Upon each state or step taken, a reevaluation will occur to recalculate which next step or state seems to be the best to take. Notice that I did not beforehand know for sure which would be the best or right steps to take. I am going to make an estimate at each state or step. I will figure things out as I go along. I will use each reward that I encounter as a further means to ascertain the next state or step to take. Given that description, I hope you can recognize that perhaps the dog that is learning to do a handshake is doing something similar to this (we can’t know for sure). The dog has to decide at each repeated trial whether to do the handshake. It is reacting in the moment, but also perhaps anticipating the potential for future rewards too. We do not yet have a means to have the dog tell us what it is thinking so we don’t know for sure what is happening in that mischievous canine mind. I want to proffer a few more insights about Q-learning and then we will bring together everything that I have so far covered. We need to steadfastly keep in mind that we are on a quest. The quest involves solving the mystery of the alleged AI that might be heading us toward AGI. Q-learning is often depicted as making use of a model-free and off-policy approach to reinforcement learning. That’s a mouthful. We can unpack it. Here are some of my off-the-cuff definitions that are admittedly loosey-goosey but I believe are reasonably expressive of the model and policy facets associated with Q-learning (I ask for forgiveness from the strict formalists that might view this as somewhat watered down): Model-based: Be provided with a pre-stipulated approach or a devised model that will henceforth be used to decide which next steps to take.Model-free: Proceed on a considered trial-and-error basis (i.e., determine each next step as you go), which is in contrast to a model-based approach.On-Policy: Be provided with a set of identified rules that indicate how to choose each next step and then make use of those rules as you proceed ahead.Off-policy: Figure out on-the-fly a set of self-derived rules while proceeding ahead, which is in contrast to an on-policy approach that consists of being given beforehand a set of delineated rules.Take a look at those definitions. I have noted in italics the model-free and the off-policy. I also gave you the opposites, namely model-based and the on-policy approaches since those are each respectively potentially contrasting ways of doing things. Q-learning goes the model-free and off-policy route. The significance is that Q-learning proceeds on a trial-and-error basis (considered to be model-free) and tries to devise rules while proceeding ahead (considered to be off-policy). This is a huge plus for us. You can use Q-learning without having to in advance come up with a pre-stipulated model of how it is supposed to do things. Likewise, you don’t have to come up with a bunch of rules beforehand. The overall algorithm proceeds to essentially get things done on the fly as the activity proceeds and self-derives the rules. Of related noteworthiness is that the Q-learning approach makes use of data tables and data values that are known as Q-tables and Q-values (i.e., the capital letter Q gets a lot of usage in Q-learning). Okay, I appreciate that you have slogged through this perhaps obtuse or complex topic. Your payoff is next. The Mystery Of Q* In Light Of Q And AsterisksYou now have a semblance of what an asterisk means when used with a capital letter. Furthermore, I am leaning you toward assuming that the capital letter Q is a reference to Q-learning. Let’s jam together the Q and the asterisk and see what happens, namely this: Q*. The combination might mean this. The potential AI breakthrough is labeled as Q because it has to do with the Q-learning technique, and maybe the asterisk or star symbol is giving us a clue that the Q-learning is somehow been advanced to a notably better version or variant. The asterisk might suggest that this is the highest or most far-out capability of Q-learning that anyone has ever seen or envisioned. Wow, what an exciting possibility. This would imply that the use of reinforcement learning as an AI-based approach and that is model-free and off-policy can leap tall buildings and go faster than a speeding train (metaphorically) to being able to push AI closer to being AGI. If you place this into the context of generative AI such as ChatGPT by OpenAI and GPT-4 of OpenAI, perhaps those generative AI apps could be much more fluent and seem to convey “reasoning” if they had this Q* included into them (or this might be included into the GPT-5 that is rumored to be under development). If only OpenAI has this Q* breakthrough (if there is such a thing), and if the Q* does indeed provide a blockbuster advantage, presumably this gives OpenAI a substantial edge over their competition. This takes us to an intriguing and ongoing AI ethics question. For my ongoing and extensive coverage of AI ethics and AI law, see the link here and the link here, just to name a few. Some would argue that it is wrong for one company to “hoard” or possess an AI breakthrough that would get us closer to or actually at AGI. The company ought to share it with everyone else. The world at large would possibly be better off accordingly. Maybe this would allow us to cure cancer by having AGI that can help do so, see my analysis at the link here. The other side of the coin is that maybe getting closer to AGI is a danger and we all face an existential risk of death or destruction, see my discussion at the link here. In that case, having one company that holds the keys to the fate of the world would seem nerve-wracking. Take a moment to deliberate on these razor-sharp questions:Should AI companies be required to disclose their AI breakthroughs?If they do so, would this inadvertently allow evildoers to use those AI breakthroughs for evil purposes?Is it fair to a company that spent its resources to devise an AI breakthrough that cannot profit from it and must just hand it over to the public at large?Who should own and control AI breakthroughs that get us into the realm of AGI?Do we need new or additional AI-related laws that will serve to regulate and govern what is happening with AI?Etc.I’ve addressed these and many other such questions in my hundreds of column postings on AI ethics and AI law, see the link here. Those are serious and sobering questions. Society needs to figure out what we want to do. One qualm is that if these aren’t addressed on a timely basis, perhaps the horse will get out of the barn, and we won’t be ready for the outcomes. Anyway, herein, I will continue the pursuit of the mystery while you give some heady contemplation to those formidable concerns. Another Theory About The Q* I’d like to bring up another theory about the meaning of Q*. Remember that I earlier mentioned there is an A*. I also mentioned that Q-learning might be the capital Q in the combined Q*.The asterisk that is in Q* could potentially be a tangential reference to A*. Thus, the belief is that Q* is actually a mashup of Q-learning and A*. You take the A* algorithm that involves path searching and graph traversal, and you mix and match this with the Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm. It is a sensible possibility. We cannot discard at face value that this might be the case. Maybe so, maybe not. For me, just to let you know, I am not opting to place my bets on that path. I’m going to remain for now with the notion that the asterisk on the capital Q is more of a general indication. It means that Q-learning has been radically advanced. Whether this advance is based on a mishmash with A*, well, maybe, but I tend to lean toward believing that the A* inclusion is not what has made things become spectacular (I will likely be mildly chagrined later on if it was a merger of A* with Q-learning, but that’s fine and I’ll approvingly make a champagne toast to the pairing). One supposes you could also ponder that if this was indeed a mashup of Q-learning and A*, maybe it would be named more suitably as QA* or perhaps Q-A*. The retort is that people in the tech field like to keep to traditions of using just one capital letter and therefore it would not be suitable to include the capital A. By convention, this logic goes, you would borrow the asterisk from the A* and plug it into the capital Q. Period, end of story. Round and round we go. Let’s bring into the picture the other two clues that I mentioned at the start. So far, we have only concentrated on the one clue of the Q* name. I had told you that it was going to be a lengthy unpacking and that it resonated like the infamous “Rosebud”. I assume you can now plainly see that this was the case. Solving Of Grade-School Level Math We are ready to consider the two other clues.I’ll start with the reported clue that the purported AI breakthrough was instrumental in being able to solve grade-school-level math problems. You will soon see that this takes us squarely into the realm of generative AI and the nature of large language models (LLMs). I have previously covered in my column postings the seemingly exasperating aspect that today’s generative AI is typically lacking when it comes to solving even the simplest of math problems that a grade-school student could readily answer, see my in-depth explanation at the link here. People are quite surprised to discover that generative AI is not especially able to figure out straight-ahead math problems. The overriding assumption is that since generative AI can produce fluent essays about all manner of topics and can answer tough questions of a wide range of historical, philosophical, and everyday subjects certainly those youngster or teenager-style math problems should be easy-peasy to solve. Not so. To give you a sense of what I am referring to, consider those types of math problems that you used to agonizingly contend with that involved figuring out when two planes will cross paths. You are told that one plane is leaving from Miami and heading to San Francisco at a speed of 550 mph and will fly at an altitude of 40,000 feet. A second plane that is going from San Francisco to Miami is leaving an hour after the first plane. The second plane will fly at a speed of 600 mph and will be at a height of 32,000 feet. Assuming that both planes fly the same course, how long will it be before the planes cross each other’s paths? I’m sure that you learned various methods in grade school that can be used to calculate and answer these thorny word problems. The problems are initially difficult to figure out, but gradually you learn the rules or steps required to get the right answer. By repeatedly solving such problems on a step-by-step basis, the process becomes nearly routine. I dare say that you’ve likely forgotten how to solve those kinds of math teasers and might find yourself today being bested by a fifth grader in a head-to-head competition. Here’s why those are tough problems for generative AI to tackle.Generative AI is essentially based on a large language model. The LLM is devised by scanning massive amounts of online text from the Internet and related sources. During the scanning, the algorithm underlying the LLM is doing mathematical and computational pattern matching on the text that is encountered. Pattern matching focuses on how natural language such as English is being used. Humans express things via text and the LLM is a model of how we say things. It is considered a large language model because it makes use of a very large data structure to encapsulate the patterning, usually an artificial neural network (ANN), and it involves scanning large amounts of text or data to do so. Suppose that during the initial scanning process, there is a posted word problem about a plane flying in one direction and a different plane flying in the other direction. Let’s pretend that one plane is going from New York to Los Angeles, while the second plane is going from Los Angeles to New York. The problem also states their speeds and when each leaves from their departure airport. Assume for the sake of discussion that the answer is that it will take four hours for them to cross paths. Here is what can happen regarding the LLM and the generative AI involved (an illustrative simplification). The large language model might have patterned on the essence of the problem based on the words used. Some words indicate there are two planes. Some words indicate the two planes are heading toward each other. And so on. The math problem of New York and Los Angeles is a lot like the math problem of San Francisco and Miami in a sense of similarity based solely on wording. As such, if you type in the math problem about San Francisco and Miami to the generative AI, it is conceivable that the computational pattern matching will find the essence of the New York and Los Angeles problems that had been encountered during initial data training. The words of the two problems will seem quite similar. And, since the answer in the New York and Los Angeles problem was four hours, the pattern matching might simply emit or generate an answer to you that the San Francisco and Miami math problem answer is also four hours. No direct calculations or formulas were invoked. You might suggest this is a monkey-see monkey-do kind of answer by the generative AI (though, realize that monkeys are sentient while today’s AI is not). The similarity between the two math problems greatly overlapped in terms of the wording. Just the wording. Based on that high percentage of wording and their word-for-word correspondences, the answer is given as being four hours. Sadly, this is not the right answer for the San Francisco to Miami problem. Let’s noodle on that. Anyone who avidly uses generative AI already likely has heard about or encountered so-called AI hallucinations. I don’t favor the terminology referring to “hallucinations” since such phrasing is unduly anthropomorphizing the AI, see my discussion at the link here. In any case, people have latched onto referring to whenever generative AI makes things up out of seemingly thin air that it is an instance of an AI hallucination. You might think the same if you had typed in the San Francisco to Miami math problem into a generative AI app and gotten the answer indicating four hours. Upon double-checking the answer by your own hand, you discover that the four-hour answer is wrong. The four hours would certainly seem to be a bogus answer and you would be perplexed as to how the answer was incorrectly derived by the AI. We shall assume that you didn’t know that the initial data training of the generative AI included a problem with New York and Los Angeles. All that you can see is that you got an answer of four hours to your prompt. The gist is that the generative AI didn’t do what a youngster or teenager is taught to do. In school, the teacher provides a set of rules and processes for the students to use to solve these math problems. The student doesn’t just read the words of the math problem. They have to extract the essential parameters, make use of formulas, and calculate what the answer is. By and large, that is not what generative AI and large language models are devised to do. These are word-oriented pattern matches. Some describe generative AI as being a mimicry of human wording. Others indicate that generative AI is no more than a stochastic parrot (though, once again, realize that parrots are sentient, and today’s AI is not sentient). Are you with me on this?I sincerely hope so. AI researchers and AI developers are working night and day to find a means to deal with this lack of mathematical reasoning in generative AI. The easiest approach so far has been to make use of an external app that is programmed to handle math problems. When you type in a math problem that you want solved, the generative AI parses the words, and sends the data over to the external program, the external program calculates a result based on coded rules and a programmed process and then returns the result to the generative AI. The generative AI then produces a nice-looking short essay that includes the externally figured-out answer. The desire instead would be for the generative AI and its large language model to be able to do these math problems without having to make use of any other app. The whole kit and kaboodle of figuring out math problems would somehow be infused within the generative AI. Various tricks and techniques have been tried to turn the corner on this existing weakness or limitation of generative AI, see my coverage at the link here. Take a deep breath. Remember that we are discussing a clue that underlies the mystery of Q*. The clue is that perhaps Q* has been able to crack the code, as it were, and can solve grade-level math problems. Assume that this is being done by some kind of souped-up Q-learning. We could potentially embed or infuse the Q* into generative AI or a large language model. Voila, we now have a handy-dandy built-in grade-level math problem solver. But there’s more. If this Q* is generalized enough, presumably it can solve all kinds of problems that involve a reasoning type of process. I had noted earlier that Q-learning makes use of a model-free and off-policy approach. In that sense, there is a solid chance that the Q* could be readily applied to zillions of types of reasoning-oriented tasks. The odds are that the testing was first done on grade-school math problems because that’s a known issue of generative AI and one that has gotten a lot of press coverage. Might as well tackle those first and then see what else can be done. Allow me to paint a picture for you. Pretend you are the CEO of a company that makes a generative AI app. Suppose you knew quite dearly that the solving of grade-level math problems has been a sore point about generative AI. People are shocked and disappointed that something so easily solved by a youngster seems to stump the latest and greatest of AI. You put your eager and erstwhile AI researchers and AI developers into this issue. They are working feverishly to find a way to deal with it. Imagine that they try everything including throwing the kitchen sink at it. Nothing seems to be moving the needle. Then, after various attempts, one of the efforts involving the use of Q-learning and adapting it in some clever ways started to show good results. They do more testing with the new bit of software and it shows tremendous promise. Grade-level math problems are repeatedly fed into this new app and the results are consistently and incredibly spot on. What would you say upon seeing a demo of this? One would assume you might be elated that a tough nut to crack appears to have been solved. Plus, you immediately have visions of what else this could potentially do. Your pulse runs fast as you realize that this might be an important AI breakthrough. The repercussions are breathtaking. I don’t want to conflate things, so I will merely indicate something that was reported in the media. It has been previously reported that Sam Altman, CEO at OpenAI, had said that on the topic of achieving AGI: “I think we’re close enough. But I think it’s important that we realize these are tools and not creatures that we’re building.” According to more recent reporting, Sam Altman supposedly said this: “Is this a tool we’ve built or a creature we have created?” Whether that pertains to Q* or has some other pertinence is not clear. In addition, it could be that the context of such remarks and the nature of them, such as maybe being uttered in a zestful or joking fashion, need to be taken into account. Let’s move to the third clue. Test-Time Computation Comes Of Age Take another sip of wine so that you are ready for this next clue. The third clue is something that has rarely been mentioned in the wacky circus of attention about the mysterious Q* but it has come up, so I thought it was worth including in our detective work. Admittedly too, it is a topic that I have had on my list of AI up-and-coming trending topics to cover for a while and hadn’t yet gotten around to it. I suppose I am fortuitously garnering two birds with one stone by covering it now (side note: no birds were harmed in the process of this analysis). I want to briefly introduce you to an area of AI that is often referred to as Test-Time Computation (TTC) also known as Test-Time Adaptations (TTA). I will only lightly skim and simplify what TTC and TTA are all about. I will be quoting from various AI-scholarly research papers that I would urge you to consider reading if this is a topic within the AI field that might interest you, thanks. Here’s the skinny. When an artificial neural network is first data trained, such as my discussion earlier about doing so within a large language model and for generative AI purposes, an important consideration is how well the scanned data is pattern matched. One concern is that the pattern matching is overly fixated on the presented data. In the statistics world, and if you ever took a class on regression, you know of this as a potential overfitting of the input data. I already brought up that we want to try and get generative AI to be able to generalize. Doing so will enable the generative AI to address matters that weren’t necessarily directly encountered when doing the initial data training. The issue at hand involves a juicy piece of terminology that you might enjoy, namely that we want the generative AI to cope with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Out-of-distribution data often refers to encountering some new data during the time that the generative AI is perhaps being used and has been put into active production. A person enters a question or topic that was never especially encompassed by the initial data training. What happens then? The generative AI might not be able to respond and therefore is usually coded to tell you that it doesn’t have anything notable to say on the matter. In other cases, as I indicated earlier, the generative AI might land on an AI hallucination and concoct something odd as an answer. You might be tempted to insist that the initial data training ought to be wider in vastness to make sure that everything of any conceivable possibility can be encompassed. That is a nice dream but not really a fulfilling solution. The odds are that one way or another, something new will pop up after the initial data training has been completed or that the pattern-matching will potentially do an irksome narrow job at the get-go. With that in mind, we can try to deal with things a bit more downstream. When the generative AI is being tested, perhaps we can help the underlying constructs to aim toward fuller generalization. The same could be said once the generative AI is rolled out into the overall release. For now, I’ll focus on the test-time circumstances. In a research paper entitled “Path Independent Equilibrium Models Can Better Exploit Test-Time Computation”, authored by Cem Anil, Ashwini Pokle, Kaiqu Liang, Johannes Treutlein, Yuhuai Wu, Shaojie Bai, Zico Kolter, Roger Grosse, and posted online on November 18, 2022, the role of test-time computation to come to grips with OOD and a desire for attaining generalization is stated this way (excerpted): “One of the main challenges limiting the practical applicability of modern deep learning systems is the ability to generalize outside the training distribution. One particularly important type of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is upwards generalization, or the ability to generalize to more difficult problem instances than those encountered at training time. Often, good performance on more difficult instances will require a larger amount of test-time computation, so a natural question arises: how can we design neural net architectures that can reliably exploit additional test-time computation to achieve better accuracy?”The goal advocated is to explore whether we can get the underlying artificial neural network to generalize in the direction of being able to solve problems that are harder than the ones encountered at the initial training time, by doing so at test time. In short, if we can give a model more test-time computation, could we potentially boost the generalizability in a considered upward problem-solving fashion? Think back to the math problem about the two planes. I already mentioned that the generative AI might not have generalized sufficiently to solve the second problem after having seen the first problem during the initial data training. Let’s make things more challenging. Suppose that we have a math problem involving twenty planes flying from multiple locations and have to figure out when they all cross each other. You could assert that this is a harder problem. Assuming that no such problem perchance arose at training time, we are maybe up a creek without a paddle on having the AI solve it. You can possibly use test-time computation and make systematic test-time adaptations to improve the underlying artificial neural network. In a research paper entitled “On Pitfalls of Test-Time Adaptation” by Hao Zhao, Yuejiang Liu, Alexandre Alahi, and Tao Lin, posted online on June 6, 2023, they describe the advantages of making use of test-time adaptations (excerpted): “Tackling the robustness issue under distribution shifts is one of the most pressing challenges in machine learning. Among existing approaches, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)—in which neural network models are adapted to new distributions by making use of unlabeled examples at test time—has emerged as a promising paradigm of growing popularity.”“Compared to other approaches, TTA offers two key advantages: (i) generality: TTA does not rest on strong assumptions regarding the structures of distribution shifts, which is often the case with Domain Generalization (DG) methods; (ii) flexibility: TTA does not require the co-existence of training and test data, a prerequisite of the Domain Adaptation (DA) approach.”Empirical studies on this topic are usually accompanied by trying out proposed methods that might show promising results. At times, the test-time adaptations might focus on changing the parameters of the model including using probabilities of uncertainty and optimization techniques. For example, in a research paper entitled “Test-time Adaptation for Machine Translation Evaluation by Uncertainty Minimization” by Runzhe Zhan, Xuebo Liu, Derek F. Wong, Cuilian Zhang, Lidia S. Chao, Min Zhang, published in the Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, July 9-14, 2023, they made these points (excerpted): “Our proposed method comprises three steps: uncertainty estimation, test-time adaptation, and inference. Specifically, the model employs the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during test time and subsequently refine the prediction through optimization.”“The results obtained from both in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluations consistently demonstrate improvements in correlation performance across different models. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the proposed method effectively reduces model uncertainty.”I don’t want this discussion to get bogged down and become exceedingly lengthy so I will conclude this third clue with a summarizing comment. It is conceivable that Q* might refer to the use of Q-learning that has been avidly adapted, including that some form of test-time computation or test-time adaptations have been used. If we are to imagine that Q* has been able to attain heightened levels of generalizability of algorithmic problem solving, there is a chance that TTC or TTA might have contributed to that presumed AI breakthrough. Don’t know if that’s the case but it is a superb tie-in of why test-time computation might be a third clue. That’s hardcore detective work. Conclusion Sherlock Holmes is about to go off the clock and pursue other riddles and mysterious puzzles. The three clues used here were certainly vibrant food for thought. We had in a sense the candlestick, the butler, and the dining room as our Clue clues, kind of. Maybe they add up, maybe they don’t. One aspect that I believe might be equally relevant is that if any of the conjecture and speculation is of substance, another take on the matter is that perhaps we are beginning to see the intermixing of the data-based approach to AI with the rules-based approach to AI. I have previously noted that I believe we are going to need to enter into an era of neuro-symbolic AI to move things forward to the next level of AI capabilities, see my discussion at the link here. In brief, we used to have the opinion that rules would be a means to devise AI. This was the likes of expert systems, rule-based systems, and knowledge-based systems. You would get people to divulge the rules they use to undertake tasks. Those rules would be entered or codified into an AI app. Sometimes this worked out well. At times, the approach was overly brittle and excessively time-consuming to devise. The gloomy AI winter ensued. Nowadays, the use of a data-based approach such as artificial neural networks is the hero and mainstay of modern AI. We are supposedly in the AI spring. Some assert that if we just keep increasing the size and scale, this will allow the existing approach to arrive at AGI. Others are doubtful of this. They tend to believe that we need to find some other approach, perhaps allied with the data-based approach. Whenever they say this, the data-based converts will decry that things will go backward into the older and disdained ways if rules are allowed back into the game. The battle going on is one that has been ongoing for a long time in the AI field. There are the rules-focused proponents, known as the symbolics because they believe that we need to symbolically encode AI. The data-based proponents are typically known as the sub-symbolics since they are at the ground level of data and are said to be less enamored of the symbolics level as an approach. Neuro-symbolic proponents contend that we can combine the symbolic and sub-symbolic, doing so to get the best of both worlds. You could somewhat compellingly exhort that if you used Q-learning and combined it in the ways I’ve above described, including immersing seamlessly into LLMs and GenAI, the conglomeration seems to blend the sub-symbolics and the symbolics together, to some extent. Is that the necessary or at least a viable path to AGI? Nobody can say for sure. A few final comments for now. The mainstream news has reported that at the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings in San Franciso, Sam Altman purportedly said this: “Four times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks, I’ve gotten to be in the room when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honor of a lifetime.” What did he witness in that room? What exactly was it that so poetically and notably pushed away a stated veil of ignorance and shined a bright light on the frontier of forward discovery? And, does the above detective gruntwork provide any forward discovery about what might have been put on display? Sherlock Holmes famously said this: “How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?” As a last word for now, Sherlock also said this: “The game is afoot.”","slug":"open-ai-qstar","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.992Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/open-ai-qstar.html","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Dana White demands Peloton bikes removed from UFC gym over past conflict with comedian Theo Von Ffff you, Peloton","date":"2023-11-24T05:36:58.000Z","path":"/post/dane-white-hate-peloton.html","text":"Dana White demands Peloton bikes removed from UFC gym over past conflict with comedian Theo Von Ffff you, PelotonDana White’s Pedal-Powered Protest at UFCNo More Peloton Rides at UFC Performance InstituteUFC’s head honcho, Dana White, has just laid down the law: It’s goodbye to Peloton bikes at the UFC Performance Institute.

ChatGPT’s Got Jokes!In the midst of executive upheaval, OpenAI’s sense of humor is still intact. In their announcement on X (the new face of Twitter), they included a rather tongue-in-cheek demo referencing the ongoing drama. Picture this: someone asks ChatGPT how many pizzas to order for a famished team of 778 – coincidentally, the approximate number of OpenAI employees. It’s a sly nod to the recent turmoil where most employees threatened to quit unless the entire board steps down. The Executive Shuffle: A Brief RecapLast week, co-founder and CEO Sam Altman faced the music and was shown the door due to alleged communication lapses with the board. In a plot twist, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella extended an olive branch to Altman and his team for a new venture at Microsoft, yet Altman might circle back to OpenAI. Greg Brockman, former OpenAI president who resigned following Altman’s exit, chimed in on X. He encouraged everyone to try the new feature, hinting at a possible return to OpenAI, as reported by The Verge. Wrapping It UpIn a world where tech updates are often dry and mundane, OpenAI has managed to add a dash of humor and intrigue. The new voice feature is a step towards more accessible and interactive AI, and the ongoing leadership saga adds a human touch to the world of technology.

We’re talking about a cyber threat that’s as cunning as it is dangerous – hundreds of malicious Python packages slithering through the web, stealing sensitive data. Let’s delve into this digital pit of vipers and understand what’s at stake. The Stealthy Strike of Python PackagesThese aren’t your garden-variety malware. They’re sneaky, sophisticated, and they’ve got a taste for sensitive data. Disguised as harmless Python packages, these cyber serpents have been lurking in the shadows of open-source platforms, waiting to strike. And strike they have, with about 75,000 downloads, each one a potential disaster. The Venom: What Are They After?These digital snakes are after everything that makes your digital life tick: Antivirus Secrets: They’re after the antivirus tools running on your device, looking for weaknesses. Personal Data: From Wi-Fi passwords to your favorite browser’s history, they want it all. Cryptocurrency: They’re eyeing your digital wallets, hoping to make a quick crypto-heist. Gaming Accounts: Yes, even your Minecraft and Roblox data isn’t safe. Social Engineering: They harvest data from platforms like Discord to manipulate and exploit. The Evolution of the ThreatThis isn’t a static threat. Like any good predator, it evolves. From plain text malware in April to multi-layered obfuscation by August, these cyber serpents are becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. They’re even learning to turn off antivirus products. It’s a digital arms race, and they’re not backing down. The Defence: Vigilance and AwarenessThe key to defending against this threat is vigilance. The cybersecurity community, especially open-source communities, need to be on high alert. It’s crucial to scrutinize projects and package publishers and to stay vigilant against typosquatting (maliciously misspelled package names). Remember, in the world of cybersecurity, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Staying One Step AheadThis cyber threat is a wake-up call for all of us. In the ever-evolving landscape of digital security, staying informed is not just a choice, it’s a necessity. As we continue to rely on digital solutions, let’s not forget the importance of cybersecurity. After all, it’s not just about protecting data; it’s about protecting our way of life.

On the one hand, that’s very helpful. On the other hand, that’s trulyterrifying. Programming is a constant game of mental Jenga: one line of code stacked upon another, building a tower of code you hopeis robust enough not to come crashing down. But it always does, as code never works the first time it’s run. So, one of the key skills for any programmer isdebugging — the art and science of finding why code isn’t running or is doing something unexpected or undesirable. It’s a little like being a detective, finding clues, and then finding out what those clues are trying to tell you. It’svery frustrating and very satisfying, sometimes at exactly the same time. I do a lot of debugging. It’s not just because code never works the first time it’s run. It’s also because I use thedebugging to tell me how the code is running, and then tweak it along the way. But while good debugging does require its own special set of skills, it’s also ultimately just programming. Once youfind out why a block of code isn’t working, you have to figure out how to write something that does work. Real-world ChatGPT testing This week, I was working on three coding tasks for software that I maintain. Two were fixes for bugs reported by users.One was a new piece of code to add a new feature. This was real, run-of-the-mill programming work for me. It was part ofmy regular work schedule. I’m telling you that, because up until now, I’ve tested ChatGPT with test code. I’ve made up scenarios to see how wellChatGPT would work. This time, it was different. I was trying to get real work done, and decided to see if ChatGPT couldbe a useful tool to get that work done. It’s a different way to look at ChatGPT. Test scenarios are often a bit contrived and simplistic. Real-world coding isactually about pulling another customer support ticket off the stack and working through what made the user’s experiencego south. So, with that, let’s look at those tasks and see how ChatGPT performed. Rewriting regular expression code In coding, we have to find a lot of patterns in text. To do so, we use a form of symbolic math called regularexpressions. I have been writing regular expressions for decades, and I still dislike doing so. It’s tedious,error-prone, and arcane. So, when a bug report came in telling me that a part of my code was only allowing integers when it should be allowingfor dollars and cents (in other words, some number of digits, possibly followed by a period, and then if there was aperiod, followed by two more digits), I knew I’d need to use regular expression coding. Since I find that process tedious and annoying, I decided to ask ChatGPT for help. Here’s what I asked:","slug":"OK-so-ChatGPT-just-debugged-my-code-For-real","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.987Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/OK-so-ChatGPT-just-debugged-my-code-For-real.html","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"tech","slug":"tech","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/tech/"}]},{"title":"The Libre Computer Le Potato Mini: The Perfect Single Board Computer for Beginners","date":"2023-10-02T13:06:08.000Z","path":"/post/the-libre-computer-le-potato-mini-the-perfect-single-board-computer-for-beginners.html","text":"If you’re looking for a cheap, powerful, and easy-to-use single board computer (SBC), then the Libre Computer Le Potato Mini is the perfect option for you.

However, the company has recently made significant investments in AI, and the release of Gemini is seen as a sign that Google is now taking the lead in this area. The Center for AI Safety, a research group that studies the potential risks of artificial intelligence, said that Google’s investment in Gemini is “no surprise” given the company’s “tremendous financial resources.” The center also warned that the spread of generative AI could pose a threat to human life, and that it is important to develop safety measures to mitigate these risks. The development of generative AI has also prompted governments to take action. China has made moves to regulate its AI businesses, while the British government is to host an “AI safety summit” in November. The United States Senate is also planning to host a series of meetings on AI safety, with the first meeting scheduled for September 13. The development of generative AI is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important to be aware of the potential risks and benefits of this technology. By working together, governments, businesses, and researchers can help to ensure that generative AI is used for good. Here are some additional points that could be included in the article: The potential benefits of generative AI include its ability to create new content, translate languages, and generate creative ideas. The potential risks of generative AI include its ability to generate harmful content, such as hate speech or propaganda. It is important to develop safety measures to mitigate the risks of generative AI, such as human oversight and content moderation.

Are you ready to dive into the world of text generation and chatbots? Buckle up, because we’re about to set up a chatbot using RunPod’s Oobabooga Text Generation WebUI template. And let me tell you, it’s easier than explaining to your grandma how to use emojis. 😂 The Starting Line 🏁 First things first, head over to RunPod and create a pod using the “RunPod Text Generation UI” template. It’s like choosing your starter Pokémon, but with fewer fire hazards. Once you’ve summoned your pod into existence, you’ll be able to connect to the text generation server on port 7860. Just click on “Connect” and then “Connect via HTTP [Port 7860].” Easy peasy lemon squeezy! The Control Room 🎛️ You’ll land on a page that looks like a minimalist’s dream. You’ll see tabs like “Text generation” and a textbox that screams, “Type something, you genius!” Below that, you’ll find some buttons and drop-downs that are preset to the Pygmalion model. Oh, and speaking of Pygmalion, it’s an unfiltered chat model, so it might occasionally spit out something NSFW. You’ve been warned, you cheeky rascal! Basic Training 🏋️‍♀️ The Pygmalion model is like that friend who’s good at parties but needs a bit of context to shine. You can use it right out of the box, but if you want to spice things up, you can load a more “characterful” character from the “Character gallery” extension at the bottom. Just click on the triangle to expand it, and voila! You’ll see example characters like “Chiharu Yamada.” Click on the picture, and you’re good to go! Let’s Chat! 💬 Once you’ve picked your character, you’ll see some text appear in the chatbox. It’s like the model is saying, “Hey, how you doin’?” You can reply by typing into the “Input” textbox. Use asterisks for actions (e.g., “I do a backflip.”) and regular text for speech. Hit “Generate,” and the model will respond as your chosen character. If the model’s reply is as awkward as a first date, just hit “Regenerate” to give it another shot. Buttons, Buttons, Buttons 🖲️ You’ll see buttons like “Impersonate,” “Remove Last,” and “Clear History.” They’re pretty self-explanatory, but if you’re feeling adventurous, go ahead and click ‘em! It’s like playing with a new toy, but without the choking hazard. The Character Tab 🎭 If you’re the nosy type and want to see what makes your character tick, click on the “Character” tab. You’ll see a profile that tells the model who it’s supposed to be. It’s like a dating profile but less cringey. Customization Galore 🎨 Want to get creative? You can create your own character profiles using Oobabooga’s online character generator. It’s like playing God but with fewer ethical dilemmas. Switching Modes 🔄 If you’re tired of the chatbot life, you can switch to a more generic text generation mode. Just edit your pod’s “WEBUI” environment variable to “textgen.” It’s like changing outfits but for your chatbot. Conclusion 🎉 And there you have it, folks! You’ve just set up a chatbot using RunPod’s Oobabooga Text Generation template. Whether you’re into creating deep, meaningful conversations or just want to mess around, this tool has got you covered.

We are going to discuss what are pre-shared keys, what is packet injection, then we will verify if your Network Interface Card (NIC) supports packet injection. Then we will go ahead and crack the WAP&#x2F;WAP2 wireless network. At the end of this blog, I have also included a video of the Aircrack-ng Tutorial for your ease that will show you how to hack wifi in real life. Note: We’re only teaching you for educational purposes and to broaden your horizons. Because we know that both ethical and non-ethical hackers use these tools, Techofide will not be held liable for any unlawful&#x2F;false actions you engage in. Methodology of WiFi Hacking WiFi hacking approach takes place in five simple steps The first stage involves configuring the WiFi adapter to set it in monitor mode also called promiscuous mode, with this mode enabled the wifi adapter can capture packets that might or might not be aimed at them. The second stage is gathering information on nearby access points. Information such as MAC address, Channel number, Authentication type, and clients&#x2F;stations connected to a specific access point. The third stage is to de-authenticate a client connected to a specific access point so we can capture a four-way handshake. For this step, we need the MAC address of the client and the access point. We can also perform several other types of attack at this stage such as Fragmentation attack, MAC-spoofing, Man-In-The-Middle attack, Evil twin attack or a dos attack to disable the AP. In the fourth stage we finally capture the four-way handshake, this step involves a bit of patience. You may not capture a handshake right away so all you need to do is wait. In the final stage, we run a brute force attack against the captured handshake. This is a resource-intensive task and the time is taken may wary depending on the wordlist and CPU speed. Now let’s see how the methodology is used in a real-world attack scenario with the help of the diagram given below. The attacker first configures his&#x2F;her own network interface card. That is the network interface card is set to monitor mode and can perform packet injection. Then the properly configured network interface card is used to perform a de-authentication attack. The de-authenticated client then reconnects to the access point. This allows us to capture the four-way handshake. We then perform a brute-force attack or a dictionary attack on the captured handshake. Once the attack is completed we have the decrypted password. Basic Terminologies Before we actually start cracking the wifi password it’s good to know a few terms that are useful to understand this blog and practical. WEP VS WAP&#x2F;WAP2 WEP and WAP&#x2F;WAP2 are security protocols that are used to secure your wireless communication. Sometimes you may see access points as open it just means they are not using any security protocols. WEP: Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is an acronym for Wired Equivalent Privacy. Different encryption tools used to secure your wireless connection are known as WEP and WAP. The least secure of these protocols is WEP. WAP&#x2F;WAP2: Wireless Protected Access (WPA) is an acronym for Wireless Protected Access. The WPA2 standard is the second iteration of the WPA protocol. The most secure of the three is WPA2. There is no difference between breaching WPA and WPA2 networks when it comes to breaking them. The authentication procedure is nearly identical. As a result, you’ll use the identical techniques. WAP3: WAP3 stands for Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 and is the Wi-Fi Alliance’s third version of a security certification programme. WPA3 is the most recent and improved version of WPA2. You can confirm that the security protocol in use is WPA&#x2F;WPA2 as shown in the above image What is Pre-Shared Key(PSK)? Protected Wi-Fi Access WPA-PSK, or Wi-Fi Protected Access, is an encryption technique that is used to authenticate users on wireless local area networks. A pre-shared key is essentially a shared secret or password that is used to verify someone’s identity when they join a wireless network. WPA2-PSK or WPA Personal are other names for WPA-PSK. In addition to pre-shared keys, WPA&#x2F;WPA2 provides a variety of authentication procedures. What is Sniffing? Sniffing is a process of monitoring and capturing all requests and data packets passing through a given network. Active Sniffing and Passive Sniffing are two types of sniffing. What is Packet Injection? Packet injection (also known as forging packets or spoofing packets) is a technique used in computer networking to interfere with an established network connection by creating packets that appear to be part of the normal communication stream. Packet injections are mostly utilized in Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, which we shall do during the deauthentication phase. What is Network Interface Card (NIC)? We can use wifi thanks to a network interface card. A network interface card is a piece of hardware that allows the computer to communicate with other computers across a network. It is a hardware component that is installed in a computer and enables a dedicated network connection to the machine. To see your NIC details, type the command below. Note: My NIC is labeled as wlp1s0, yours may be different. iwconfig What is Aircrack-ng? Aircrack-ng is a comprehensive set of tools for evaluating the security of WiFi networks. It focuses on various aspects of WiFi security, including: Monitoring: Packet capture and data export to text files for additional processing by third-party tools Attacking: Packet injection attacks include replay attacks, de-authentication, and the creation of bogus access points, among other things. Testing: Checking the capabilities of WiFi cards and drivers (capture and injection) Cracking: WEP and WPA PSK Cracking (WPA 1 and 2) The tools are all command-line-based, allowing for a lot of scripting. A great variety of graphical user interfaces have made advantage of this feature. It is available for Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, and even eComStation 2. We will be using the airmon-ng, airodump-ng, aireplay-ng, and Aircrack-ng tools from the Aircrack-ng suite. Let’s look at their usage. Airmon-ng: Monitor Mode Airmon-ng is used to manage wireless extensions modes. To sniff a wireless connection, you must switch your wireless card from managed to monitor mode, which is done with airmon-ng. Monitor mode allows your card to listen in on all packets in the air. Normally, only packets intended for you will be “heard” by your card. We can later capture the WPA&#x2F;WPA2 4-way handshake by listening to every packet. Airodump-ng: Authentication Handshake Airodump-ng is a wireless sniffer that can collect data from several wireless Access Points. It’s used to look for nearby Access Points and record handshakes. Aireplay-ng: Deauthenticate Client Aireplay-ng is a replay attack and packet injector tool. Users can be de-authenticated from their APs in order to collect handshakes. This step is only required if you’ve decided to speed up the process. Another constraint is that the AP must be connected to a wireless client at this time. If no wireless client is currently connected to the AP, you must be patient and wait for one to connect before capturing a handshake. You can go back and repeat this step if a wireless client arises later and airodump-ng fails to capture the handshake. Aircrack-ng In order to find the key, Aircrack-ng is used to attack WPA&#x2F;WAP2 wireless protocols. For cracking the password Aircrack-ng uses brute force attack against the captured handshake. The drawback of using Aircrack-ng to brute force is that it utilizes CPU instead of GPU which makes the attack slow. Aircrack-ng Download and Install The Aircrack-ng suite is pre-installed on most security-focused distributions. However. if you’re using a non-security distribution like Ubuntu or Mint, type the command below. Ubuntu or Mint sudo apt install aircrack-ng #installs aircrack-ng suite How to use Aircrack-ng? Now that we have learned everything that needs to do practical, let’s actually crack the wifi password. Step 1: To get rid of any conflicting process type the following command. Make sure to type this command otherwise it may cause problems later. sudo airmon-ng check kill Step 2: Next start the wireless card aka WLAN in monitor mode, by using the following command: [This step refers to the Configuring NIC stage as aforementioned] sudo airmon-ng start wlp1s0 You’ll see that wlp1s0 has been set to monitor mode in the above image. Step 3: Enter iwconfig to verify that the interface is properly configured. Note: Notice the interface name has changed from wlp1s0 to wlp1s0mon. iwconfig You can see that wlp1s0mon is in monitor mode. It’s critical to double-check all of this information before moving on; otherwise, the next stages will fail. Step 4: This is a simple test to see if your card is capable of supporting injection. Type the following command. Note: Sometimes it may say Found 0 AP, which could mean that you are not physically close to the AP or the signal strength is weak. sudo aireplay-ng –test wlp1s0mon Analysis of the response: 22:42:58 Found 1 AP: The broadcast probes or received beacons were used to locate these access points (APs). 22:42:58 84:D8:1B:06:EF:06 - channel: 11 - ‘Druid’: Notice that this AP is on channel 11. 22:43:04 0&#x2F;30: 0% for Druid: This is the only AP with which the card can communicate effectively. This is a different type of verification that your card can perform. Note: Essid’s are the names of the access points and Bssid is the MAC addresses associated with them. Step 5: Now, We will use Airodump-ng to capture the traffic and 4-way authentication handshake for the target Access Point we’re interested in. Enter the following command. [This step refers to the Gathering remote wifi information and capture handshake stage as mentioned before] sudo airodump-ng wlp1s0mon There are several options available in this command such as -d which creates a filter removing jitters. Note: You can also send this information to Wireshark for static analysis by specifying a filename with the -w option. When a wireless client is joined to the network, it appears like this: Notice the WPA handshake: 84:D8:1B:06:EF:06 in the top right-hand corner of the screen above. This signifies that the four-way handshake has been successfully collected by airodump-ng. You can also use tcpdump for the same. Also notice that in the Notes section we can see EAPOL which stands for Extensible Authentication Protocol(EAP) over LAN and it’s a type of message sent by the access point to the station. Here it is with no handshakes are found: Step 6: Use Aireplay-ng to de-authenticate the client. [This step refers to de-auth any connected user stage as mentioned before] This phase notifies the wireless client devices that it is no longer connected to the access point. Hopefully, the wireless client will then reauthenticate with the AP. The 4-way authentication handshake we’re interested in gathering is generated by the reauthentication. We utilize this to crack the WPA&#x2F;WPA2 pre-shared key. You determined which client is currently connected based on the output of airodump-ng in the previous step (04:C8:07:15:71:C0). For the following, you’ll need the MAC address. Open a new terminal and type: aireplay-ng –deauth 0 -a 84:D8:1B:06:EF:06 -c 04:C8:07:15:71:C0 wlp1s0mon Where: --deauth means send deauthentication beacon. 0 is the number of deauths to send (0 means infinite) -a 84:D8:1B:06:EF:06 is the MAC address of the access point -c 04:C8:07:15:71:C0 is the client’s MAC address, this is optional but sending directed deauth is better wlp1s0mon is the interface name Step 7: Run Aircrack-ng to crack the pre-shared key. You’ll need a dictionary of words as input for this. Aircrack-ng basically takes each word and checks to see if it is the pre-shared key. The rockyou.txt file, which contains a list of common passwords, can be downloaded here. [This step refers to brute force captured packet stage as mentioned before] Note: If you are using a security OS such as Kali or Parrot Security, you can find the wordlist in &#x2F;usr&#x2F;share&#x2F;wordlists directory. Open up a new terminal and type: sudo aircrack-ng -w rockyou.txt -b 84:D8:1B:06:EF:06 psk*.cap Where: -w rockyou.txt is the name of the dictionary file. If the file isn’t in the same directory, make sure to specify the full path. *.cap is just the name of a set of files that contains the packets that were captured. Notice how we utilized the wildcard * to include many files in this situation. When no handshakes are identified, the following is typical output: If this occurs, you must repeat step 6 (de-authenticating the wireless client) or wait longer if you are utilizing the passive option. At this point, Aircrack-ng will attempt to decrypt the pre-shared key. This could take a long time, even days, depending on the speed of your CPU and the size of the dictionary.

I started with the test build, pretty much just building it for functionality, wont be pretty, but it needs to work. The first iteration of this was built with scrap 1x2’s, some metal gear&#x2F;wheels I found in my garage and some belts for said gears. After the first iteration worked, I notated what I wanted to do for the final product and that consisted of Make it less noisy, I used an old RC car motor to power it, it did work, but was a bit louder then id like Program the compatibility for Alexa&#x2F;Google Home After long hours of getting those completed, I was left with exactly what I wanted This is the final product!!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhTumKpOBA0 Happy with the outcome!

His mind, as always, will begin thinking, could this be made lucrative? he mentioned how much the rental was, i forget what that figure was now, but if i were to guess, probably around the $500 range for a full evening..? but in order to purchase a machine yourself i think he said around $1,800, ive also looked up a couple myself and see the anywhere from $1,800-$3,600. So of course this would promt me to turn the gears in my bring to devise a cheaper alternative, being a tech, gadget, programmer, and raspberry pi addict, knew it would be done for pennies on the dollar. So i started with Github, of course. i knew i had all the parts needed, so it wasnt that big of a process. 3 hours later, i had a completed adapt of a Photo Booth! of course i didnt care enough to build the whole “booth” part, although if for some reason, i found a wild up my arse, that wouldnt be an issue either, i would just be driving myself crazy for a few days deciding how i would want to design it. but anywhoo….. The Raspberry Pi is the heart of the booth, currently the photos are being snapped with a PiCam, which can be switched for damn near any ofther camera with the proper programming modifications. but i feel the PiCam Is not only adequate for this but maybe ever over powered. Ive got 2 basic&#x2F;analog push buttons, running through a breadboard. The two button control the main features of the booth. Blue Button starts the picture taking process (after you choose if you want to take 1 or 4) and the red button (after pics are taken) will send the image to your local wifi enabled printer to autoatically print","slug":"tinker-time-raspberry-pi-photo-booth","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.993Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/tinker-time-raspberry-pi-photo-booth.html","categories":[{"name":"Tech Stuff","slug":"Tech-Stuff","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Tech-Stuff/"}],"tags":[{"name":"home","slug":"home","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/home/"},{"name":"tech","slug":"tech","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/tech/"},{"name":"DIY","slug":"DIY","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/DIY/"}]},{"title":"Tinkering - Cheap Electric Lantern","date":"2022-12-12T04:33:20.000Z","path":"/post/tinkering-cheap-electric-lantern.html","text":"I had the idea for a latern for a while, a couple years ago (ok i might be abit of a pack rat) a buddy gave me 2 really cool looking hanging lanterns. he was just going to throw them away so i took them and stashed them until the right time, and the right time came. I was browing at walmart and found an light bulb that is supposed to suplicate the looks of an actual fire. While staying within my realm (lol) seeing as it was $7, i snatched it so i could make a blog about it! This project was fairly simple, i just drilled a hole in the top of the lantern in which i ran the wires up a chain i had laying around… the power wire i intertwined within the chain and sent that on up thru the ceiling. After fishing the wire out of the celiing i grabbed one of my handy dandy “Sonoff Wifi Switch’s” ($9) and set that up to power its actions. And after all was said and done, as far as a the operational test #1, im happy with the turnout!!!!

Once upon a time, in the land of Asgard, Thor was the proud owner of the mighty hammer Mjölnir. But, as fate would have it, Thor’s evil brother Loki had other plans for the powerful weapon. In “Thor: Ragnarok,” Loki tricked Thor and sent Mjölnir flying into the depths of space. Thor was left hammerless and stranded on the planet Sakaar. But Thor is not one to give up easily. With the help of his trusty companions, including the Hulk and Valkyrie, Thor set out on a mission to reclaim his hammer and save Asgard from destruction. However, when Thor finally found Mjölnir, it was too late. The hammer was destroyed by the fire demon Surtur, leaving Thor once again without a weapon. But, as the saying goes, “When one door closes, another one opens.” Thor soon met the dwarf blacksmith Eitri, who helped Thor create a new weapon, the powerful axe Stormbreaker. With Stormbreaker in hand, Thor was ready to take on any challenge that came his way. He returned to Asgard and defeated Loki and Hela, saving his home and his people. So, in the end, Thor may have lost Mjölnir, but he gained something even greater: the powerful and versatile Stormbreaker. And as they say, sometimes it’s the things we lose that lead us to something even better. So, if you ever find yourself in a similar situation, just remember: don’t lose hope, because you never know what new and exciting opportunities might be just around the corner.

Dont get Manti Te'o'd !!!","date":"2021-11-08T01:39:14.000Z","path":"/post/dont-be-fooled-by-fake-accounts-how-to-find-out-if-who-your-messaging-is-real-or-not.html","text":"Dont be fooled by fake accounts, How to Find out if who your messaging is real or not! So this lil story has a little backing to it. This woman started texting me on Facebook messenger, of course first thing I did was check her profile. SHOCKER, she didnt have a Facebook profile she just had messenger. Of course I asked her about it and there were the excuses, blah blah. At this particular time in my timeline, I was in florida working, and I was out there alone, so having somebody to bullshit with wasn’t a bad thing. I was sure the person was fake, but didnt really pry. Long story short, chatted with her&#x2F;him&#x2F;it for a few weeks then lost interest. She recently started hitting me up again and now that I had a little more leisurely time on my hands I figured I would solve this damn puzzle. So I started off with, “hey lets video chat” … excuse excuse excuse…. So now its grind time. **Backstory, when I was in florida she lived in florida, months later now she live in New Jersey, and she works at a Orphanage (cmon now)** She would always call me “babe” (not sure why) so I started what I call the “bait questions” , in order to bait them into a reply or something in which im trying ti place them. So I asked if she likes movies, of course she answered yes. Then joked around about like most girls im sure she can never pick a movie, she agreed. That was the setup, I recent found a pretty cool website that helps couples pick a movie, haven’t used it yet but was very intrigued. The man picks a movie and the girl picks one and it finds one with the likeness of both blah blah blah, thats not the point. The point is im trying to setup a legitimate reason to get her in my playing field… Ill explain For those who dont know, there is a process called “IP logging” or “URL IP Logging” and its very simple. What it does is this Im sure everybody has seen “url shortening links” like when you see a google link that looks like goo.gl.hdye748 or something of that nature, thats just google shortening the link for whatever reason, aesthetics or whatever. Well now you can do that same process but also embed a code in that newly made URL that will track whoever clicks its IP address. The Process: You pick a website (a real website) , remember should be something intriguing that will make sure they click it Goto any IP Logging URL shortener Plug in the Bait url and this is Very important, when its shortening the url it’ll give you options as to what the “disguised url” will come out as, now you can just makeup whatever you want you have to look at which ones they offer, thats why I chose the URL for the movie thing , because one of the disguised URLs they offered was dating.club, I felt that was hidden enough not to second guess it After you made your link, keep on with your story. Paste the link and wait for your logger to tell you the info. So long story short, here is the OUTCOME!","slug":"dont-be-fooled-by-fake-accounts-how-to-find-out-if-who-your-messaging-is-real-or-not","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.989Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/dont-be-fooled-by-fake-accounts-how-to-find-out-if-who-your-messaging-is-real-or-not.html","categories":[{"name":"Tech Stuff","slug":"Tech-Stuff","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/Tech-Stuff/"}],"tags":[{"name":"tech","slug":"tech","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/tech/"},{"name":"relationship","slug":"relationship","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/relationship/"},{"name":"texting","slug":"texting","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/texting/"}]},{"title":"Deathstroke Mask","date":"2020-01-07T06:17:11.000Z","path":"/post/deathstrokemask.html","text":"This mask is inspired by “Deathstroke”, again, like most of my masks, i throw in a little twist. #block-yui_3_17_2_1_1578376814101_25845 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid { margin-right: -10px; } #block-yui_3_17_2_1_1578376814101_25845 .sqs-gallery-block-grid .sqs-gallery-design-grid-slide .margin-wrapper { margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; } [youtube&#x3D;:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com/watch?v=01Bnn8ffB6I&amp;w=640&amp;h=480\\]","slug":"deathstrokemask","updated":"2025-11-30T18:29:26.989Z","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/post/deathstrokemask.html","categories":[{"name":"3d Print","slug":"3d-Print","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/3d-Print/"},{"name":"DIY","slug":"DIY","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/categories/DIY/"}],"tags":[{"name":"3dprint","slug":"3dprint","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/3dprint/"},{"name":"superhero","slug":"superhero","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/superhero/"},{"name":"3d","slug":"3d","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/3d/"},{"name":"dc","slug":"dc","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/dc/"},{"name":"deathstroke","slug":"deathstroke","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/deathstroke/"},{"name":"mask","slug":"mask","permalink":"https://www.protocolsentinel.com/tags/mask/"}]},{"title":"Thors Hammer","date":"2020-01-03T23:07:58.000Z","path":"/post/2020-1-3-thorshammer.html","text":"Thors HammerI think the title speaks for itself, THORS HAMMERS!!!
