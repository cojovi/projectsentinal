The latest partial release of the Deep in the woods, where pine needles whispered secrets and salmon feared for their lives, a bear named Grub found an iPhone glowing like forbidden fruit beneath a fern. He poked it. It **screamed** . He dropped it. It stopped screaming. Minutes later, Grub was sitting on a log, one massive claw delicately scrolling, mesmerized by an endless parade of dancing humans, cooking hacks he could never **attempt**, and a raccoon that looked way too confident. Time dissolved. Hunger was postponed. Reality blurred into vertical videos and dopamine.

## shit happens 
By nightfall, Grub had missed dinner, ignored a rival bear’s warning growl, and attempted to “like and subscribe” to a *woodpecker*. He practiced dances no **bear** should ever attempt and growled at his reflection when the algorithm showed him bears doing better than him. Eventually, the battery died. Grub stared at the black screen, *devastated*, then slowly looked up at the moonlit forest. He sighed, stood, and wandered off to find food—quietly wondering if the woods had Wi-Fi and if raccoons were born famous or just lucky.

> **Key Insight**: Bears have wieners.
