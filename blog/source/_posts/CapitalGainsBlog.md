# **Capitol Gains: The High-Stakes War to Ban Congress from Stock Trading**

When a normally sleepy Senate committee in late July advanced a bill to **prohibit lawmakers from trading individual stocks**, the 8-7 vote should have been a yawner—86 % of Americans want the practice stopped. Instead, the session detonated a political blast radius stretching from Capitol Hill to Mar-a-Lago. Senator **Josh Hawley** broke with fellow Republicans, former President **Donald Trump** blasted him as “second-tier,” and what began as an ethics tweak morphed into a test of partisan loyalty. <!--  -->

## **1. Transparency Failed: Lessons from the STOCK Act**

The 2012 STOCK Act banked on sunlight: lawmakers could keep trading, they just had to disclose deals within 45 days. Reality check:  
* **$200 fines** became a cost of doing business.  
* Ethics committees routinely **waived penalties**.  
* **78 members** missed disclosure deadlines in 2023 alone.  

COVID-era briefings turned the failure into farce—senators privately dumped millions while publicly calming markets, and **no one was charged**. Transparency didn’t rebuild trust; it weaponized outrage. <!-- :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} -->

## **2. Two Rival Fixes, One Philosophical Split**

| Feature | **HONEST Act (Hawley / Peters)** | **Ban Congressional Stock Trading Act (Kelly / Ossoff)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Covered | Members, spouses, **President & VP** | Members, spouses, **kids** |
| Compliance | **Full divestment**; blind trusts *banned* | **Divest or** qualified **blind trust** |
| Penalty | 1 month salary *or* 10 % of asset value | TBD (softer) |
| Philosophy | “Only a total ban restores trust.” | “A truly blind trust works.” |

Blind-trust skeptics argue trustees can wink and nudge; advocates say forcing liquidation punishes honest wealth-holders. The fight isn’t over mechanics—it’s over whether Congress can ever “manage” temptation or must **kill it outright**. <!-- :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} -->

## **3. Arguments in the Arena**

**Pro-Ban**  
* Near-universal voter support (≈ 87 %).  
* Even *appearance* of insider trading shreds legitimacy and compliance with laws. <!-- :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13} -->  
* Simple: serve constituents, not your portfolio.

**Anti-Ban**  
* Could deter wealthy outsiders from running for office.  
* Existing laws already cover insider trading (they say).  
* Cato Institute warns markets lose valuable information if insiders can’t trade. <!-- :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14} -->

The public frames it as **fairness**; many lawmakers frame it as **financial inconvenience**. That gap explains why overwhelming popularity hasn’t meant swift passage. <!-- :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15} -->

## **4. Beyond Stocks: Closing the Revolving Door**

Reformers link the trading ban to a broader crackdown on Washington’s money loops—like lifetime bans on former members *lobbying* Congress. The message: unplug every outlet where public office feeds private enrichment. <!-- :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16} -->

## **5. Will It Pass?**

Trump’s public whipping of Hawley spooked GOP leadership; without a floor vote, the HONEST Act likely dies unless stapled to a “must-pass” bill. Still, the sheer breadth of voter anger means **some** version is inevitable. The only question is *when* and *how strong*. <!-- :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17} -->

## **Final Take**

Congress tried “trust us” transparency and got a decade of scandals. Now voters want a **bright-line ban**, and senators must decide whether to serve Wall Street, K Street, or Main Street. Whatever compromise emerges, one truth is clear: public patience with self-policing is out of stock.
