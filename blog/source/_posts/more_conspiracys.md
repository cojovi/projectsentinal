Election Security: A Rollercoaster of Drama and Suspense

In a world where binge-watching political dramas is the norm, the real-life twists and turns of election security are giving those TV shows a run for their money. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has recently sent out a nationwide memo to secretaries of state, warning of "extremely alarming" threats. It seems our next election might have more suspense than the season finale of your favorite series.

Since the nail-biting 2020 presidential showdown between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, election security has catapulted from a subplot to the main storyline. The saga, with its cliffhanger that took days to resolve in Biden's favor, spawned a series of lawsuits faster than you can say "recount." Some conservatives, led by Trump, didn't just cry over spilled ballotsâ€”they claimed the whole milk carton was rotten, leading to the infamous Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.

Now, in a plot twist no one saw coming (or did we?), Trump is waiting in the wings, facing a criminal trial after being indicted on four counts for allegedly attempting to script his own ending to the 2020 election saga. The charges read like the back of a blockbuster movie cover: conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government and obstruct an official proceeding.

But wait, there's more! Last August, Trump and his ensemble cast of 18 others were indicted by a Georgia grand jury for their alleged roles in trying to overturn the state's 2020 results. The Republican front-runner for the 2024 nomination, in a move that shocked absolutely no one, pleaded not guilty to all charges.

According to Timothy Langan, the FBI's equivalent of a leading man in the Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch, "The threat environment, unfortunately, is very high." He delivered this line at the winter conference of the National Association of Secretaries of State in Washington, making everyone wish they had popped some popcorn before the meeting started.

As we brace ourselves for the next episode in this ongoing political thriller, one thing is clear: the path to the 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be anything but boring. With the stakes higher than ever, our nation's secretaries of state are on the front lines, armed with nothing but their wits and an unwavering commitment to democracy. 

So, grab your favorite snack and settle in. This is one show you won't want to miss. And remember, unlike TV dramas, the outcome of this story affects us all. Let's make sure we play our part by staying informed, engaged, and ready to vote. Because in the end, the future of our democracy is not just in the hands of those who lead us but in the actions of every voter.

Newsweek attempted to reach out to the FBI for a sneak peek into the next season, but at the time of writing, our emails remain as unanswered as the questions surrounding the next election. Stay tuned, folks. The drama is just getting started.
