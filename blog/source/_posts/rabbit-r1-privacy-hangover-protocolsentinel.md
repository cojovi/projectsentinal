# Rabbit R1: Hype, Reality, and the Privacy Hangover

### Quick context
Rabbit R1 is one of those “cute little gadget, big promises” launches: a small device that’s supposed to do real tasks for you (music, rides, food orders, etc.) by driving app interfaces on your behalf.

### If you want the technical breakdown (and the specs)
If you want the technical breakdown, here’s my Rabbit R1 deep dive over on Tech Done Cheap → [The Rabbit R1 AI Gadget: A Deep Dive into 2024's Exciting Technological Leap](https://blog.techdonecheap.com/post/rabbit-ai-lam)

### Why I’m intrigued
The core idea is honestly spicy: instead of needing every service to ship an API integration, the assistant learns the *workflow* and executes it. That could make “do the thing for me” assistants way more useful than the usual voice-assistant party tricks.

### Why my security-brain immediately starts sweating
A device that can “click buttons like a human” is powerful… and power cuts both ways:

- **Credential gravity:** to do real tasks, it eventually needs to touch accounts (rides, payments, email, calendars). The moment credentials enter the chat, the threat model gets real.
- **UI automation is brittle:** websites and apps change constantly. If it “learns” a flow, a small UI change can turn “order tacos” into “order 40 tacos.” (Ask me how I know. 🙃)
- **Social engineering bait:** anything marketed as “it logs in and handles stuff for you” becomes prime phishing material. Users will be trained to trust prompts they shouldn’t.

None of that means “don’t use it.” It means “treat it like a chainsaw.” Useful, but you don’t juggle it.

### How I’d use it (without living dangerously)
- Start with **low-stakes tasks** (music, timers, directions).
- Use **separate accounts** where possible.
- Don’t hand it the keys to anything you can’t afford to have mis-fired.
- Assume you’ll need a **manual fallback** sometimes.

### Closing
I’m rooting for this category, but I’m not handing my digital life to a gadget just because it’s orange and confident.
