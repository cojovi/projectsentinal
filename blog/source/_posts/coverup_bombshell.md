# Cathy O’Brien Strikes Again — And Epstein’s Back in the Mind‑Control Spotlight

Alright, grab your tinfoil hats. Cathy O’Brien — yes, *that* Cathy O’Brien, the self‑proclaimed MK‑Ultra survivor — is back, arguing the Epstein files are being “slow‑walked” to conceal real mind‑control operations. Nostalgia tour meets conspiracy buffet.

## So what’s she actually saying?

- She insists she secretly testified to Congress in the ’90s and has been “100% vindicated.”
- She claims the Epstein document releases are delayed to bury bigger mind‑control programs.
- Translation: The public story is the decoy; the real show is off‑books.

## Tone check: snarky but grounded

Her history is a cocktail of dramatic allegations often labeled uncorroborated by scholars and reporters. Believe her or not, she’s still pushing the narrative harder than a midnight AM‑radio host.

## TL;DR

| Claim | What She’s Saying | My Take |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Secret Congress Testimony | ’90s testimony, totally vindicated. | “Trust me, bro” energy. |
| Epstein Cover‑Up | Files are slow‑walked to hide mind‑control ops. | Possible? Sure. Proven? Not here. |
| Vindication | She says she has it. | We haven’t seen it. |
