# Protocol Sentinel – Session documentation

## 2026-02-24 – RSS feed fix (Aurora-only)

### Problem
RSS feed was not considered “active and working.” Constraint: do not modify `blog/_config.yml` to avoid breaking the Aurora plugin.

### Findings
- **Feed file**: `rss.xml` is already generated by `hexo-generator-feed` (configured in `_config.yml`). The file is valid and present at `blog/public/rss.xml` with correct channel and item data.
- **Aurora theme**: No built-in RSS autodiscovery or feed link in the theme; no references to `rss`/`feed`/`atom` in the Aurora theme or `hexo-plugin-aurora`.
- **Fix location**: All changes were made only in `blog/_config.aurora.yml` so the main Hexo config and Aurora plugin behavior stay untouched.

### Changes made (all in `blog/_config.aurora.yml`)

1. **RSS autodiscovery in `<head>`**  
   Under `injects.head_begin`, added a new inject block at the top:
   - `<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Protocol Sentinel" href="/rss.xml">`
   - This lets browsers and feed readers discover the feed from any page.

2. **Footer link to RSS**  
   Under `footer_links`, added a new section before “Pish Posh”:
   - Title: `Feed`
   - Link: `RSS` → `/rss.xml`
   - Gives users a visible way to open the feed.

### Verification
- Ran `npx hexo generate` from `blog/`; build succeeded.
- Checked `blog/public/index.html`: the RSS `<link rel="alternate" ...>` appears in the document head.
- Confirmed `blog/public/rss.xml` exists and contains valid RSS 2.0 with correct `link` and `atom:link` (e.g. `https://www.protocolsentinel.com/rss.xml`).

### Notes
- `blog/_config.yml` was not edited. Feed generation (path, type, limit, etc.) remains entirely in the main config.
- Aurora plugin and theme behavior are unchanged except for the added inject and footer link.
